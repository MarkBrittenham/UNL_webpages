If you wish to cut a path<br>

In the modern world of math<br>

You must spout a lot of things.<p>



You must show you know topology <br>

And e'tale cohomology<br>

In physics, mention strings.<p>


You can live a life of pleasant ease<br>

Because a set of PDE's<br>

Is just a space of loops.<p>



You should act a bit convival<br>

And tell them that is trivial<br>

If they think of quantum groups<p>



Chorus:<br>

<dl><dd>And everyone will beam

<dd>When you tell them of your scheme

<dd>To make them see

<dd>A la Bourbaki

<dd>That if only one tries,

<dd>Then hyperbolic manifolds and affine planes

<dd>are wavelets in disguise.</dl><p>



And of course you'll give a lecture<br>

On the Poincare Conjecture<br>

Make it full of double talk.<p>



But: don't hint that you can do it,<br>

Others did and lived to rue it,<br>

And use plenty of colored chalk.<p>



You will want to put in lots<br>

Of invariants for knots;<br>

Keep the lemmas coming fast.<p>



Then: if their eyes grow bleary<br>

Just invent a subtle theory<br>

That will settle Fermat's last!<p>



Chorus: (Gilbert's words unchanged)
	
<dl><dd>And everyone will say
	
<dd>As you walk your mystic way:
	
<dd>If this young man expresse himself
	
<dd>In terms too deep for me,
	
<dd>Why, what a very singularly deep young man
	
<dd>this young man must be</dl>
