Most mathematics department web servers can be found on this 
<a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/MathLists/Contents.html"><font size=+1> 
list</font></a> at Penn State University. Of particular use are 
their sublists of <a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/MathLists/DeptUSA.html">US 
departments</a>
and <a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/MathLists/Journals.html">journals 
with Web pages</a>.<p>

Another list of web servers is kept at 
<a href="http://euclid.math.fsu.edu/Science/Servers.html">Florida State</a><p>

The <a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu">Geometry Center</a> of course has a 
great deal of interest to the low-dimensional topologist, such as Jeff Weeks'
<a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/download/snappea.html">SnapPea</a> 
program. Note that a more complete port to the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.msri.org/pub/Computing/Math_Software/NXSnap/">NeXT</a> was 
done by <a href="http://www.msri.org/staff/bio/joe/">Joe Christy</a>.<p>

<a href="http://www.msri.org/">MSRI</a> has its 
<a href="http://www.msri.org/preprints/archive.html">preprint archive</a> as 
well as an <a href="http://www.msri.org/MSRI-preprints/">index</a> of its 
most recent  MSRI preprints. Many of the latter are available for downloading.<p>

The <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a> allows you to 
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/verity/srchawd.html">search</a> by keyword for basic
information on grants past. present, and future. You can also download 
documents to help you prepare your grant proposal, and find out 
<a href="http://www.nsk.gov/mps/dms/">closing dates</a>.<p>

The <a href="http://www.math.ufl.edu/math/abook-menu.html">Geometry and Topology 
Address Book</a> has its own page at the University of Florida.<p>

<a href="http://www.ams.org/era/">Electronic Research Announcements</a> of the AMS. <p>

A new electronic journal entitled <a href="http://www.maths.warwick.ac.uk/gt/">Geometry 
and Topology</a> has been inaugurated at the University of Warwick. Here is the 
<a href="misc/gt.txt">announcement</a> that appeared in 
<a href="news:sci.math.research">sci.math.research</a> newsgroup.<p>

A <a href="http://almira.ceremab.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/periodiques?">site</a> 
in France has <font color="666666" size=+1>scans</font> of the contents pages pages
for about 300 journals that you can <a href="pac168-2.gif">view</a>. About 
the only use I can see for it is for grabbing scans of journals that your
own papers have appeared in, but maybe I'm just being unimaginative?<p>

<a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet">MathSciNet</a>; you can access it 
if your institution has paid the appropriate fee.<p>

The <a href="http://www.emis.de/cgi-bin/MATH/">Zentralblatt fur 
Mathematik</a> is available on-line; for institutions not paying the 
appropriate fee, every search produces at most three entries.<p>

The <a href="http://bighorn.lanl.gov:4002">SciSearch Database</a> is a 
massively cross-indexed database of articles from 1985 to the present. 
The service is only available, however, in New Mexico. Try it though, and 
let me know if this is really true!<p>

Rob Kirby has produced an updated version of his 
<a href="ftp://math.berkeley.edu/pub/Preprints/Rob_Kirby/Problems/">problem list</a>, 
available by anonymous ftp from <font color="0f1fff"> math.berkeley.edu 
</font> in the directory <font color="0f1fff"> /pub/Preprints/Rob_Kirby/Problems/ 
</font>. It is 377 pages long, a 4.2 meg Postscript file. 1137 bibliographic 
entries! You will probably need to send it to a printer with the command 
<font color="0f1fff"> lpr -s </font> so as not to overload its memory.<p>

An <a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~eww/math/math.html">online 
encyclopedia of mathematics</a>, at Caltech.<p>

It doesn't really belong here, but I couldn't resist a link to 
this <a href="http://www.uark.edu/depts/comminfo/www/grants.html">huge 
list</a> of links to pages containing grant and fellowship information. 
I found it while linking the Sloan Foundation to my vita.<p>

The Topology Atlas is hosting a web-based 
<a href="http://www.unipissing.ca/topology/course/index.htm">course
in topology</a>, including lecture notes and solved problems for 
a course in undergraduate topology.<p>
