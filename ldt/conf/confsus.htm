from the University.
<p>
<li> University of London, Royal Holloway College, Egham, Surrey near
London. Monday 15 April-Thursday 17 April 1997. This is the annual
British Mathematical Colloquium which has low dimensional topology as
a special session this year.
</ol>
<p>
Participants may take part in both or either of the above. However 
participants who wish to take part in the second part must organise
their visit through the British Mathematical Colloquium (BMC). The BMC
is being organised by Dr G.de Barra, Dept of Maths, Royal Hollaway,
University of London, Egham, Surrey, TW20 0EX, Britain. email:
<A HREF="mailto:g.debarra@rhbnc.ac.uk">g.debarra@rhbnc.ac.uk</A>.
More information on the BMC can be found 
<a href="http://galisteo.ma.rhbnc.ac.uk/bmc.html">here</a>.
<p>
<b>Itinary:</b> participants can arrive at the University of Sussex
Conference Centre, Chelwood Gate, independantly if they wish.
Otherwise a coach will take participants on Friday evening at 6pm
from the University, Mathematics Dept. to the Centre where a meal
will be available.
<p>
Lectures will take place on Saturday, Sunday and Monday morning. A
coach will take participants in the second part on Monday after lunch
to the BMC at Egham.
<p>
The Tuesday afternoon session will be used as a showpiece of low
dimensional topology. The speakers are J.Montesinos, J.Hoste and
M.Boileau.
<p>
<b>Divertions:</b> there is a comfortable lounge at the centre and the bar
will be open in the evenings. It is possible to walk a short distance
through the woods to the Red Lion pub. Other walks are possible but
since the month is April the weather could be problematic. If there
are clear evenings it will be possible to use the telescope and
astronomical observatory.
<p>
<b>Costs:</b> &#163;229 sterling, this includes conference fee, all meals
and accomodation from dinner Friday 11 to lunch Monday 14 April and
coach travel from the University. A charge, depending on demand, will
be made for transportation to Egham on the Monday after lunch. Please
send payments by cheques made out from a British bank or by
international money orders.
<p>
As mentioned earlier participants who wish to take part in the BMC
from Monday pm onwards part must organise their visit through Dr G.de
Barra, address above.
<p>
<b>Deposit:</b> a refundable deposit of &#163;50 sterling is payable by 1
February, 1997. After then a late booking fee of &#163;30 sterling
will be charged.
<p>
<b>Diet:</b> Let us know if you have any special dietary requirements.
<p>
<b>Funding:</b> a small amount of money has been set aside by the LMS but I
would ask participants to find their costs from their own grants, if
at all possible. Priority help for accomodation but not travel costs
will be given to speakers and British postgraduates.
<p>
<b>Transport:</b> the University of Sussex is easily reached by rail or road
from London or Gatwick airport or the channel ports. London is most
conveniently reached from Heathrow airport by underground train. The
conference centre is most easily reached by taxi from Haywards Heath
station. The telephone number of the centre is 01825 740283
<P>
<b>Participation:</b> If you are interested in this conference please

The Centre cannot take many more than 40 residents. So numbers
above this will have to be accomodated in nearby guest houses.
