<B>Title</B>: Reflections on algebraic geometry over groups<P>

<B>Abstract</B>: The object of this talk is to put in place the 
framework of a theory for groups which parallels the beginnings of
classical algebraic geometry and to reflect on analogues in this 
theory of the Hilbert basis theorem and Hilbert's nullstellenssatz.
The work that will be described is joint with Alexei Miasnikov and 
Vladimir Remeslennikov.

<B>Title</B>:   Openness results for group actions on metric spaces<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
I will report on joint work with Ross Geoghegan aiming towards extending 
scope and range of application of the 
Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz--geometric invariant.<P>

Let G be a group of type F_n and X the universal cover of a 
K(G,1)-complex with finite n-skeleton. Central to our techniques is 
the concept of ``finitary map'' f: X^n -> X^n -- a 
generalization of G-equivariant map. We consider a locally compact 
geodesic metric space M and the space R(G,M) of all actions of G
on M by isometries. Every action r in R(G,M) can be lifted to a 
G-equivariant map h: X -> M and we use this lift h to define 
whether our finitary map f: X^n -> X^n  `` shifts in the 
direction'' of a point a in M (or, for that matter, in the direction 
of an end e in bd M). Then we prove, as our main application, 
that the set of all representations r in R(G,M) for which such a 
finitary shift f: X^n -> X^n towards some a in M exists is an 
open subset of R(G,M).

In the case when r in R(G,M)is a discrete representation it turns 
out that the existence of a finitary shift f as above is equivalent 
to the property that the point stabilizer Stab_G(a) is of type 
F_n.  Thus our general result contains an openness result on 
stabilizers of such actions. The special case when n = 1 and M is 
the Euclidean space  E^k with G acting by 
translations recovers Walter Neumann's openness result (1979) on the set 
of all finitely generated normal subgroups with infinite cylic 
quotients, which was one of the starting points of the geometric 
invariant.

<B>Title</B>: Connectedness properties of ideal boundaries and limit sets<P>
  
<B>Abstract</B>: 
We describe some results relating to convergence actions on
continua which have applications to boundaries of hyperbolic
groups and limit sets of geometrically finite groups.
For example, under certain hypotheses one can deduce that
every global cut point is a parabolic fixed point.
In particular one can use this in showing that the boundary of
a one-ended hyperbolic group is locally connected.  Along
similar
lines one can derive the JSJ splitting of such a group.
The techniques involve ideas from convergence groups,
actions
on R-trees and the theory of group splittings.

<B>Title</B>: Groups acting on non-positively curved complexes<P>

<B>Abstract</B>: Following a brief survey  of what is known
about groups which act on spaces of non-positive curvature, I
shall concentrate on the case of 2-complexes and explain how
the geometry can be used to obtain results of group theoretic
interest: these include the classification of subgroups of
FxF and the construction of biautomatic groups with
no finite quotients.

<B>Title</B>: On the Conformality of Planar Tiling-Sequences<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
Joint authors: W. J. Floyd and W. R. Parry. 
A tiling-sequence is a sequence of tilings of a planar or
spherical domain where the first tiling is given and the subsequent
tilings arise from the first by a well-defined finite subdivision
rule. The fundamental problem is to determine which tiling-sequences,
given combinatorially, can be realized geometrically so that they
are (essentially) preserved by the action of a Kleinian group. The
characteristic property of those that can be so realized is a
combinatorial conformal-modulus property that we call the conformality
condition. Recognizing conformality is a delicate problem with a
beautiful theory. At present we can handle tiling-sequences in which
there is a great deal of reflectional symmetry. We can also handle
constant valence subdivision rules with only one tile type (for which
tilings have natural fractal structure but an underlying linear
algebra). Conformality can be interpreted as a problem associated
with the dynamics of combinatorially given expanding maps of the plane.
We intend to explain the state of the art in recognizing conformality.
Our dream is to recognize conformality with enough precision to solve
the problem for which the notion was created: is a group Kleinian if
it is negatively curved ( = word hyperbolic) and has as its space at
infinity the 2-sphere?<P>

<B>Title</B>: Nonpositively curved piecewise Euclidean structures on
hyperbolic manifolds<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
(Joint work with M. Davis and G. Moussong) We show that every
hyperbolic Riemannian manifold can be given a piecewise Euclidean structure
with "extra large" links. We also discuss a generalization of this
"flattening" procedure (due to C-K Wong) to piecewise hyperbolic
complexes.

<B>Title</B>:Group actions and regular maps on non-orientable surfaces<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
In this lecture I will show that for every positive integer p there exists
a compact non-orientable surface of genus p with automorphism group of
order at least 4p if p is odd, or at least 8(p-2) if p is even.  The lower
bound of 4p represents a doubling of the former known lower bound on the
maximum number of symmetries of a non-orientable surface of given genus.
I will also report on progress (in joint work with Colin Maclachlan and
Steve Wilson) in proving the lower bound of 4p is sharp for infinitely
many p congruent to 3 modulo 12.  

This turns out to be closely related with the question of existence of 
regular maps (symmetric graph embeddings) on non-orientable surfaces of 
certain genera, investigated in joint work with Brent Everitt.

<B>Title</B>: Injectivity of maps between Artin groups<P>


<B>Abstract</B>: I shall describe a sufficient condition for the injectivity
of a homomorphism between Artin semigroups which allows one
to describe a large class of such injective maps.
The homomorphism between Artin groups induced by any map
in this class may be topologically realised via a 
corresponding inclusion of Salvetti complexes. 
In the case that the Artin groups involved are both of
finite type, the group homomorphism is found to be 
injective and hence the inclusion of complexes is
\pi_1-injective.

<B>Title</B>:   A small cancellation characterization of hyperbolic groups<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:  The (word) hyperbolic groups of Gromov are defined by
a geometric condition on their Cayley diagrams, and  small
cancellation presentations are a rich source of hyperbolic groups
of dimension two. We present a small cancellation condition which
characterizes all hyperbolic groups. That is, every hyperbolic group
admits a presentation satisfying the condition; and every such
presentation defines a word hyperbolic group.

<B>Title</B>:   Unique tensor factorization of irreducible projective 
                representations of groups<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
A projective representation of a finite group G can always
be expressed as an internal tensor product of projective
representations of G each of which is `tensor-irreducible'.
This talk considers when such a tensor factorization is `unique'.
In the negative direction unique tensor factorization can fail to hold
even when G is cyclic and the underlying field is algebraically closed.
In the positive direction we prove, for certain classes of
groups and fields, that unique tensor factorization of  irreducible
projective representations does hold.

<B>Title</B>: Artin groups, rewriting systems, and three-manifolds<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
 In joint work with John Meier, we construct finite complete
rewriting systems for two large classes of Artin groups:
those of finite type, and those whose defining graphs are
based on trees.  The constructions in the two cases are
quite different; while the construction for Artin groups
of finite type uses normal forms introduced through
work on complex hyperplane arrangements, the rewriting
systems for Artin groups based on trees are constructed
via three-manifold topology.  This construction naturally
leads to the question: Which Artin groups are three-manifold
groups?  Although we do not have a complete solution,
the answer, it seems, is ``not many."

<B>Title</B>: Canonical Words for Braids <P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
The braid groups  are interesting examples of automatic groups that do not
appear to be shortlex automatic (except for braids with =BE 3 strands).
Thurston's canonical words will normally be much longer than the minimum
length equivalent word.   Kay Tatsuoka has proposed a canonical form for
braid words, based on the representation of the Cayley graph as a union of
'flat'  subgraphs.  This paper investigates the recognisibility of such
canonical forms.

<B>Title</B>: Out(F_n)-action on a simplicial complex<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:Let G be a group with actions on trees.  The G-trees can be
parametrized by the space of the translation length functions.  The outer
automorphism group Out(G) acts on it.  Hatcher and Vogtmann studied
the simplicial complex SF_n, which is the (unordered) factorizations
Z_0*...*Z_k*H of F_n.  They proved that SF_n is
((n-3)/2)-connected.  They used SF_n in their calculation of the
homology groups of Aut(F_n).   We redefine SF_n using our notations.
By applying the theory developed by Bass and Jiang, we calculate the vertex
stabilizers of Out(F_n)-action on SF_n.  A minimal
Out(F_n)-invariant subgraph, Y, of the one skeleton of SF_n is
defined.  The vertices of Y are the equivalence classes of F_n-trees
whose quotient graph is either an n-leaf rose or a (n-1)-leaf rose.
We obtain the following exact sequence
1->\pi_1(Y)->G_0*_{G_{01}}G_1 ->Out(F_n)->1,
where G_0 is the automorphism group of an n-leaf rose, and G_1 is
virtually abelian.

<B>Title</B>:  Subgroup Separability of 3-Manifold Groups<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
I will mention an example (due to Burns, Karrass, and Solitar) of a compact
3-manifold M whose fundamental group is not subgroup separable (non-LERF)
and show that M is a graph manifold and its fundamental group is an HNN
extension.  Using a method of Rubinstein and Wang, I will show that some
surfaces (with boundary) immersed in M cannot lift to an embedding in any
finite-degree cover of M.  I will also mention some extensions of this
criterion.  Finally, I will construct 3-manifolds with a cubing of
non-positive curvature which admit non-separable immersed surfaces and
conclude the talk with proposing some related problems and conjectures.

<B>Title</B>: Quasi-isometry classification of the solvable Baumslag-Solitar
groups<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
Joint with Benson Farb.

Abstract: The solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups are the groups

     BS(1,n) = &lt a,b : b a b^{-1} = a^n &gt

It is well known that BS(1,n) and BS(1,m) are commensurable if and
only if m,n are powers of a common integer. We prove that they are
quasi-isometric if and only if they are commensurable. The proof uses
a metric 2-complex X_n on which BS(1,n) acts properly discontinuously
and cocompactly. We define an "upper" and "lower" boundary of X_n, and
we put metrics on these boundaries, so that the bilipschitz classes of
these metric spaces are quasi-isometry invariants of BS(1,n). The
upper boundary is the space of hyperbolic planes in X_n, and it is
isometric to the n-adic rational numbers Q_n.  The proof is finished
by applying a theorem of Daryl Cooper which says that Q_n and Q_m are
bilipschitz equivalent if and only if n,m are powers of a common
integer. We also discuss some progress towards characterizing those finitely
generated groups which are quasi-isometric to BS(1,n).

<B>Abstract</B>: Some new embedding schemes of arbitrary sets of groups into
infinite groups with preassigned properties have been obtained using
the method of cancellation diagrams. Among their applications we mention
the existence of the following groups: 1) a 2-generator simple infinite
complete group all of whose maximal proper subgroups are infinite
dihedral; 2) an uncountable group G in which all proper subgroups are
countable such that OutG is a given group of cardinality less than or equal
to
|G| and G contains every countable group (assuming CH); 3) a
nondiscrete
Hausdorff topological group of cardinality $\aleph_{n}$, where n is any
nonnegative integer, with no proper subgroups of the same cardinality and
with each proper subgroup discrete; 4) a group of a given infinite
cardinality which is isomorphic to all its nontrivial normal subgroups
and other than simple groups, free groups of infinite rank and the infinite
cyclic group.

<B>Title</B>: Tensor factorisations of matrix groups<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:Given a finite dimensional vector space V, 
we construct a family of
projective geometries whose flats are certain subspaces of V, and
show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between this family

tensor decompositions of V.  This provides one component
of a practical algorithm for finding a tensor decomposition
of a finite dimensional KG-module, or proving that no non-trivial
tensor decomposition of the module exists. We will discuss
these geometries and outline aspects of the algorithm.

<B>Title</B>:  Locally finite subgroups of free Burnside groups of large even exponents<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
The main part of the talk will present recent joint results of S.V.Ivanov
and A.Yu.Olshanskii on locally finite subgroups of free Burnside group B(m,n)
of even exponent n. We consider n \ge 2^48, n is divisible by 2^9 and the
number of generators m > 1. Under these assumptions, a complete description
of all infinite groups that are embeddable in B(m,n) as (maximal) locally
finite subgroups is given. Any infinite locally finite subgroup L of B(m,n)
is contained in unique maximal locally finite subgroup while any finite 2-
subgroup of B(m,n) is contained in continuously many non-isomophic maximal
locally finite subgroups. In addition, L is locally conjugate to a maximal
locally finite subgroup of B(m,n). To prove these and other results,
centralizers of subgroups in B(m,n) are investigated. For example, it is
proven that the centralizer of a finite 2-subgroup of B(m,n) contains a
subgroup isomorphic to a free Burnside group of countably infinite rank and
exponent n; the centralizer of a finite non-2-subgroup of B(m,n) or the
centralizer of a non-locally finite subgroup of B(m,n) is always finite; the
centralizer of a subgroup S is infinite if and only if S is a locally finite<P>

<B>Title</B>:  The number of fixed-point-free orthogonal transformations of
finite vector spaces of even order<P>

<B>Abstract</B>: 
I will discuss the problem of estimating the number of nonsingular
matrices in the orthogonal group $O^\pm (d,q)$ ($d$ and $q$ even) for which
the only fixed vector in the underlying vector space $V$ is the zero
vector. This problem arose in connection with a more general study
by Peter M.~Neumann and myself of the proportion of cyclic matrices in
classical groups. The techniques we had developed failed (spectacularly)
to give a usable lower bound precisely in the case of orthogonal groups
over fields of order $2$.
<P>
In this exceptional case we derived a recursion relation between the
number of unipotent matrices and the number of fixed-point-free matrices
in orthogonal groups of various dimensions. This allowed us to derive
a functional relation between the generating functions for these
quantities. From these generating functions, and a result of Steinberg
about the numbers of unipotent matrices, we were able to obtain the
bounds we needed.

<B>Title</B>: The geometry of group extensions<P>

<B>Abstract</B>:     If G is a group then by a 3-presentation (for G) we
will mean a pair (P, D) where P is an 
ordinary presentation of G and D is a collection of spherical diagrams (or
pictures) over P
representing a set of generators of the second homotopy module of P. A basic
question is the
following: if G is an extension of K by H, and if one knows 3-presentations
for K and H, then
determine a 3-presentation for G. This poblem has been recently solved in
joint work with
Y.G. Baik and J. Harlander. In fact, this work considers wider questions.
Let
 P(H) = &lt A; R, &gt  P(K) = &lt X; T &gt
be presentations for H, K respectively. Then any extension of
K by H will have a presentation
of the form

(*)   P = &lt A, X; r=w(r) (r in R), T, xa=au(a,x), ax=v(a,x)a
		 (a in A, x in X) &gt

where the w's, u's and v's are words on X. However, in
general, if G is the group defined
by P then G will not be an extension of K by H because the
natural map K--->G will not be
injective. We will say that P is developable if this map is
injective. By analysing 
presentations of the form (*) geometrically we show that
there is a procedure (which
can be made algorithmic under suitable conditions on P(H),
P(K)) to determine for
any P as in (*) whether or not it is developable, and if so
to compute a 3-presentation
for G given 3-presenations for H and K. When P is not
developable one can obtain a
 presentation on X for the subgroup of G generated by X. (A
special case of this was done
by Conway/Coxeter/Shephard.). Morover, one can still
compute a 3-presentation for G.

<B>Title</B>: Almost a generalization of a theorem of Muller and Schupps<P>


<B>Abstract</B>:
A number of theorems connect classes of groups with the sorts of computing
machines necessary to solve the word problem in those groups.  For example,
Anissimov and Seifert show that a group is finite if and only if its word
problem can be solved by a finite state automaton.


A celebrated theorem of Muller and Schupp states that the word problem in a
group can be solved by means of a pushdown automaton if and only if that group
is virtually free.

There is a class of computing machines which generalize the pushdown automata,
to wit: nested stack automata.  These machines have their storage capacity
organized in a tree-like manner.  This increase in computing power translates
into an ability to recognize considerably more complicated languages.

Surprisingly, this increased computing power does not seem to confer any
group-theoretic advantage.  In joint work with Gilman and Grigorchuk, we show
that under mild assumptions on our nested stack automaton, the word problem in a
finitely presented group can be solved by means of a nested stack automaton if
and only if that group is virtually free.

When G is an HNN extension with finitely presented base group H,

of a word hyperbolic group satisfies a polynomial isoperimetric inequality.

listing all  word hyperbolic groups.

<B>Abstract</B>:Given a finitely generated free group F with a basis A, 
and a finite set of elements R of F, 
there exists an algorithm to determine whether or not
some set of conjugates of the elements of R belongs to 
a proper free factor of F.  This can be done, in fact, 
by using the ``cut vertex'' idea of Whitehead
from 1936.  Geometrically, this can be mirrored on a Heegaard diagram of a
closed orientable 3-manifold, and the result is to obtain what Volodin,
Kuznetsov, and Fomenko in 1974 called a ``wave'', 
for certain special types of
diagrams; this gives a way to discuss ``strongly irreducible'' diagrams.

<B>Title</B>: Tracks and splittings of groups<P>


<B>Abstract</B>: Using Dunwoody's tracks, we (G.A.S and G.P.Scott) prove:

If G is a torsion free hyperbolic group with one end and if G has a  two ended 
subgroup H such that the number ends of the pair
(G,H) is greater than or equal to two, 
then G splits over some two ended subgroup.

 Subsequently, the theorem without the assumption  about torsion has been
proved by B.Bowditch by different methods.<P>

<B>Title</B>: Totally Disconnected, Locally Compact Groups <P>
<B>Abstract</B>: Each totally disconnected, locally compact group G has a
compact, open subgroup U. If U is normal, then G is an extension of
the discrete group G/U by the compact group U and this extension
describes the relationship between the algebraic and topological structures
of G. However, not every totally disconnected, locally compact group has
a compact, open, normal subgroup.

The talk will discuss some theorems which say precisely how the compact,
subgroups of G may fail to be normal. The example of the group of
automorphisms of a homogeneous tree will be used to illustrate the
theorems. These theorems are strong enough to have answered several
conjectures but at the same time suggest further questions and thus appear
to point the way to a more complete structure theory for totally
disconnected groups.
