Hi-

Jon Corson and I have just gotten a state grant for a conference
this coming spring. I am writing in the hope that you might be
interested in coming. Here are the tentative details so far:

conference:  G^3  =  Geometric Groups on the Gulf coast
organizers: Steve Brick and Jon Corson
location: University of South Alabama campus in Mobile, Alabama
dates: Thursday, March 26, 1998 thru Saturday, March 28, 1998
plenary speaker: Steve Gersten
other speakers: John Stallings, Mike Mihalik, and others TBA
types of talks: there will be a number of one hour talks and
       a couple of sessions of 20 minute talks so that everyone interested
       can speak.
goals: For this year, we hope to put out a proceedings volume.
       We also want to turn it into a annual event. In the future,
       we hope for stronger and earlier financial support (we're sorry that
       this announcement is sort of late in the year for an event in the
       spring).


Please let me (or Jon) know if you are interested in coming
and if you're willing to give a talk. We will let you know further
details as they become available.

Regards,

Steve Brick
