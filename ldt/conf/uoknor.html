 There will also be 20-minute contributed talks in the evening of May 10th 

for those who wish to speak. Contributed talks on any aspect of the theory or

are welcome.  If you plan to give a talk, please indicate the title on

the registration form and send us an abstract of less than one-half a

page.


 SUPPORT:
 -------

 The conference is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation 
and the University of Oklahoma. The order of priority for the provision of 
support is:  Plenary speakers, invited speakers, contributed speakers, 
younger colleagues (including graduate students and new (1991 and 
later) Ph.D.'s) who have no other support, everybody else.  It is our 
expectation that we will be able to provide all participants with a small 
travel allowance (e.g. car pools from neighboring states), a private room in 
a hotel (Sooner House) for all who need a place to stay, and all meals from 
Friday dinner through Sunday breakfast. There will be no registration fee.


 TRAVEL INFORFRMATION
 --------------------

 If you are planning to travel by air, you should book your flight into 
Oklahoma City (not Tulsa!). The following major airlines service Oklahoma 
City: American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, TWA, and United.  
The airport is located in the southwestern portion of Oklahoma City and is 
about a 30 minute drive from Norman (via I-240 and I-35).  There is a 
possiblity we will be sending some cars to the airport to pick up conference 
participants during the afternoon and evening of May 9, so please send us 
your arrival time so that we won't miss you.  Limousine service is available 
between the airport and Norman.  The coupon rates are $18 for one passenger, 
$12 apiece for two,$10 apiece for three, etc.  If you plan to take the 
limousine, let us know and we will mail or fax you a coupon. Taxis from the 
airport to Norman cost about $30-35 and, of course there are several rental,
car agencies.


  ORGANIZING COMMITTEE:
  --------------------

 The organizing committee consists of Marilyn Breen (Oklahoma), Paul Goodey 
(Oklahoma), Robert M. Hardt (Rice), Ralph Howard (S. Carolina), Robert Miner 
(Minnesota), Gerard Walschap (Oklahoma) and Shihshu Walter Wei (Oklahoma).


  SUBSEQUENT ANNOUNCEMENTS:
