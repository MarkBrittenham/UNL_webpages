 Park City is a beautiful resort city in the scenic Wasatch mountains
 and late June is a perfect time of year to visit.  Hiking and biking
 on mountain trails, shopping on historic Main Street and dining in
 Park City's numerous restaurants are among the many activities available.
 The Olympia Park Hotel is a top notch resort hotel.  Its amenities
 include two restaurants, a bar, a huge glassed over pool area, and
 workout facilities.  We have negotiated a deeply discounted room rate
 of $55.00 per room per night for the duration of the conference.  The
 nearest airport, Salt Lake International airport, is approximately 40
 miles distant from the meeting site.  Those interested in attending the
 conference should make reservations as far in advance as possible
 (and  a minimum of a month in advance) to guarantee availability of rooms
 at the discount rate. The toll-free number for the Olympia Park Hotel
 is 1-800-234-9003 and their address is 1895 Sidewinder Drive,
 Park City, Utah 84060.  We would also like to point out that Southwest
 Airlines usually offers very reasonably priced flights from the western US
 to Salt Lake that time of year ($100 round-trip fares are not uncommon).
