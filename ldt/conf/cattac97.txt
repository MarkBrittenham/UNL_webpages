       CATSKILLS TACONIC TOPOLOGY DAY

         Saturday, May 10, 1997
             Vassar College
          Poughkeepsie, New York


  The purpose of CatTacTopDay is to get the low-dimensional topologists in
the greater Hudson River Valley region together for a day to share research
ideas, hear some talks and get to know one another.

Speakers are:

Gretchen Wright:  "Braid Theory in 3-manifolds"

Edith Starr: "Knottedness"

Maria Morrill: "Non-existence of closed de Sitter manifolds"

Brian Mangum: "Pseudo-Anosov Flows and Virtual Fibration."

Amelia Jones: "2-Generator knots and links: generators, relators and
geometry"

Liz Finkelstein: "Tubed incompressible surfaces in knot and link
complements"

Mark Brittenham: "A Laminators `most wanted list' for knots"

Colin Adams: "Short geodesics in hyperbolic knot and link complements"

We hope that all interested parties will attend!  All talks will take place
in
Rockefeller Hall, Room 310, at Vassar College.  The talks will each be
approximately half an hour long and will begin at 10 am, continuing until
about 5:15 pm. We will then adjourn to a local restaurant for dinner.
