<a href="http://www.msri.org/people/staff/joe/">Joe Christy</a> has put together
<a href="http://www.computop.org">www.computop.org</a>, to serve as a source
for the computational 3-dimensional topology community. The site includes links to 
downloadable software, and a set of mailing lists.<p>

The page of the 
<A href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/PureMaths/MIN_SET/CONTENT/RESEARCH_GROUPS/knots.html">
Knot Theory Group</a> at the Univ. of Liverpool.<p>

An introduction to 
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/mega-math/gloss/knots/knots.html">knot theory</a> 
which seems to be aimed at teachers of mathematics can be found at 
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>.<p>

There is also another 
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/contributions/scharein/KnotSquare.html">knot 
theory</a> page at the University of British Columbia.<p>

<a href="http://www.yucc.yorku.ca/~mouse/knots/knots.html">Another page</a>, developed 
from a course for liberal arts students, is at York Univ.<p>

A discussion, and several lists, concerning the classification of knots, may be
found in <a href="http://sgi.ifh.de/~aneziris/contents">Charilaos Aneziris'</a> home page.<p>

This <a href="table9.gif">table</a> of knots up to nine crossings came 
from <a href="http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/~sean/">Sean Collom</a>'s home page at Oxford.<p>

A collection of pages on 
<a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/ma/CPM/exhibit/welcome.htm">Mathematics 
and Knots</a> at the University of Wales.<p>

A huge page of <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/suber/knotlink.htm">links</a> 
to pages on knots and knot theory of all kinds.<p>

An <a href="http://www.amsci.org/amsci/issues/Comsci97/compsci9711.html"article</a> 
on knot theory appears in the November 1997 issue of <a href="http://www.amsci.org/amsci/">
American Scientist</a>.<p>

A page at the Univ. of Liverpool for accessing 
<a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~su14/knotprints.html">preprints</a> on knot theory.<p>

<a href="gopher://math.berkeley.edu/11/Topology">Berkeley's Topology 
gopher archive</a> contains, among other things,  Joyce Riley's bibliography 
of reviews in knot theory (up to about 1990) from Math Reviews.<p>

A <a href="http://www.gang.umass.edu/docs/archive/knots.html">catalog</a> of 
energy-minimizing configurations of knots, at UMass.<p>

Since I couldn't find them, I took the SnapPea files for the knots with up to 
11 crossings that Joe Christy had with his version of snappea on the NeXT, and
had SnapPea2.0 convert them to the new file format. They live in two files, 
one for knots up to 10 crossings and one for 11 crossing knots. For up to 
10 crossings, you can pull the file across as a 
<a href="knots/10knots.sit.hqx">BinHexed Stuffit</a> archive (108K) 
<font color="0f1fff">(let me know if it works now)</font>. For 11 crossings, 
you can also get the <a href="knots/11-knots.sit.hqx">BinHexed Stuffit</a> archive.<br>
I've found these files to be
<b>the</b> best way to figure out what the knot I've drawn <b>is</b>. I ask
SnapPea what the volume of the one I've drawn is, and compare the number with
<a href="knots/knotlist.txt">this list</a> of the (hyperbolic) knots up to 
11 crossings listed in order of increasing volume. (The list came from Joe's 
version of snappea; thanks to Irena Swanson for telling me that the Unix `sort' 
command could sort the <b>second</b> word in a line!). If all you want are 
the knots and volumes, this <a href="knots/knot11cr.dvi">Dvi file</a> (or 
this <a href="knots/knot11cr.ps">Postscript file</a>) is easier to work with.<p>

I've now also added zip archives for the <a href="knots/10knot.zip">knots 
up to 10 crossings</a>, as well as the <a href="knots/11knot.zip">11-crossing knots</a>.
These files have been converted from Mac-readable to PC-readable form (thanks to 
<a href="http://www.dataviz.com/Products/CPW/CPW_Home.html">Conversions Plus</a>,
so that they can be read into A.C.Manoharan's 
<a href="ftp://ftp.geom.umn.edu/priv/weeks/">port of SnapPea</a> to Win95/NT.
The port seems stable; so far, I've only crashed it by trying to read in a Mac-readable
knot file (hence the conversion...)!<p>

These files came in handy while exploring what knots a construction 
(with Rachel Roberts) of persistent laminations worked for; read more 
about it in my <a href="../personal/pprdescr.html#perseif">paper descriptions</a>.<p>


The program
