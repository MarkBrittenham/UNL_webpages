This information was also lifted out of the web page for a previous conference 
at UNT, so, again, the pricing information is likely to be a bit dated. (In 
particular, before I went on leave I heard an (unconfirmed) rumor of a 
significant price increase at the Radisson.)<p>

<h3> Dormitory housing </h3>
The <a href="http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2053_other.html">housing information page</a>
at the AMS web site has announced that a campus residence hall will be available
for conference participants, at a rock-bottom price of $12 to $17 per night. These
are suites, a total of four beds in two rooms. The rooms come with bedsheets and 
precious little else.

being the conference headquarters; it is billed as a conference center...)
