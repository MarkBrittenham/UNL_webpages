Subject: URGENT: I-35E north to close at Lake Dallas<p>

<b>PLEASE MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN YOUR CLASSES IMMEDIATELY---</b><p>

If you plan to travel to Denton on northbound I-35E  tomorrow (Friday)
or this weekend, the following is information you need to know:<p>

I-35E northbound to close at Lake Dallas Friday through Sunday<p>

The Texas Dept. of Transportation announced today that I-35E
northbound will be closed for an emergency bridge repair at the Lake
Dallas overpass beginning at 9 a.m. Friday, Feb. 19, and continuing
24-hours-a-day until the job is finished. Officials expect the repairs
to be finished by late in the day Sunday, Feb. 21, if all goes as
planned.<p>

Northbound traffic on I-35E will be reduced to one lane and diverted
to the access road at Lake Dallas just north of the Lake Lewisville
bridge. Drivers can expect delays of <b><font size=+1>up to two hours</font></b> 
during peak
traffic hours. Students, faculty and staff affected by the closure on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday are strongly encouraged to plan
alternative routes to UNT.<p>

Guests and musicians involved with the opening events at the Lucille
G. "Lupe" Murchison Performing Arts Center are strongly encouraged not
to use I-35E when traveling to the events because of the likelihood of
heavy delays. However, because the southbound lanes are not affected,
I-35E will be an effective route for those returning to Dallas and
northern suburbs. <p>

For those traveling to the opening events for the Murchison Performing
Arts Center, the UNT Police recommend the following alternative
routes:<p>

>From Dallas: Take Hwy. 114 west past the DFW International Airport to
I-35W. Take I-35W north to Denton. Exit at Bonnie Brae and remain on
the I-35E service road. Turn left at Ave. D and proceed to the Fouts
Field parking lot. Drive time from the Texas Stadium area is
approximately one hour. There is no construction on this route.<p>

>From the Plano area: Take Hwy. 289 (Preston Road) north to Hwy. 380
and turn left (west) to Denton. In Denton, turn left at Carroll Street
(south), travel to Oak Street and turn right (west). Take Oak to Eagle
Drive and turn left (south). Proceed to the Fouts Field parking lot.
Drive time from Plano is approximately one hour or longer because of
construction on Hwy 380. Drivers will experience several miles of
construction from the Hwy. 377 juncture to Loop 288 at the eastern
edge of Denton. <p>

Please note: TxDOT realizes the inconvenience this causes for UNT.
However, officials advise that two accidents have recently caused the
overpass at Lake Dallas to become dangerous, and these repairs must be
made now. The overpass at Lake Dallas will be completely closed
throughout the repairs.<p>
