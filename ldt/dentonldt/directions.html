<title>Getting to Denton</title>

<center><font size=+3 color="0f0fdf">Getting to Denton</font></center>

<p>

<font size=+2>Driving:</font><br>

Denton lies at the top of the "Golden Triangle", whose other vertices are
Dallas and Forth Worth. In more mundane terms, Denton lies where I35E (from
Dallas) and I35W (from Fort Worth) come up from the south to rejoin into I35,
which continues on to the north to OK City and points beyond. The university itself
is just off (east) of I35E, about one mile south of the 35E/W split, at either the
Avenue D (exit 466B) or McCormick St. (exit 466A) exits. I prefer the Avenue D exit. <p>

I35E and I35W rejoin south of D/FW into I35, to continue south to Austin and beyond. From 
south of D/FW, you will probably want to take I35W, to avoid Dallas traffic, although
there is (or was, in December) more construction on I35W, in both directions.
The best advice is to just avoid rush hours. From the east you will probably want 
to take I635 up to I35E, although, again, this road is often crowded most of the 
work day. On the other hand, the I30/I35E interchange is known as the 
MixMaster among the locals, which should tell you something about going *that* way.
From the west, you will want to take I820 up to I35W. But then, if you're
driving from the west, you either already know that or are driving a *really* long
way....<p>

Usually the traffic in and around Denton doesn't get too bad, although sometimes
<a href="I35Eclose.html">strange things happen</a>....<p>

By the way, as you drive into town, the really big buildings you see are *not* UNT; 
they belong to Texas Women's University (TWU).<p>

<font size=+2>By air:</font><br> 

The two main choices of airport are Dallas/Ft. Worth
(DFW) and Dallas Love Field (DAL). Denton has a municipal airport, but nobody flies
there. DFW is an American Airlines hub, with flights from there to practically everywhere
(but, significantly (for the author of this page), not Lincoln, NE). Every other major
airline has flights to DFW from their hub(s). Southwest Airlines operates out
of DAL (there are also American flights to/from Austin); but the Wright Amendment makes
it illegal for SWA to fly from DAL to any state other than Texas or its adjacent states
(AR,LA,NM,OK). What this basically means (since nearly all of their destinations are
west) is that you have to fly through El Paso or Albuquerque, and you can't check your
luggage through. (Technically, they can't book the flights, either; you usually have to
reserve half of them, hang up, and call back to reserve the other half. That's politics
for you; the intent of the Wright Amendment was to *force* DAL to close. It failed.)<p>

Both airports are about 45 minutes to an hour away from Denton. DFW is about 10 miles 
south along SR121 from I35E (exit 450). DAL is about 3 miles east along Mockingbird 
Lane (well, not quite; you turn (left) onto Cedar Springs from Mockingbird) from 
I35E (exit 433B). A corollary is that DAL is much closer to downtown Dallas (exit 428), 
something to take into account near rush hour.<p>

<font size=+2>Airport shuttles, taxis, car rentals:</font><br>

I lifted the following information out of a web page for a previous conference at UNT
(about 2 years ago); the prices may therefore be slightly dated. <font color="0f0fdf">
Note that the airport shuttle operates by reservation only; they do not operate on a 
fixed schedule.</font><p>

Denton is approximately 30 miles north of Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
International Airport and about 40 miles north of Dallas Love 
Field Airport (served by Southwest Airlines).

<h3> Ground Transportation from DFW Airport: </h3>

Weekend rates for rental cars tend to be competitive
with airport shuttle costs but less expensive than
taxi service. From DFW take the north airport
exit and take route 121 north/east to I-35E north to Denton.

<P>Airport shuttle service between DFW Airport and Denton costs 
$20 (?)
per person one way. If two or more people make reservations and are 
picked up together, one way fare for each additional passenger is 
$10 (?). The shuttle service requests reservations at least a day
in advance. Call 1-940-565-9936.

<p>  Denton taxicabs provide 24 hour service. Rates are 
approximately $40-$45 one way. 1-940-898-8294 or 1-940-383-4155.
(Both numbers are for the same company.)

<h3> Ground Transportation from Love Field: </h3>

Weekend rates for rental cars are significantly less expensive
than taxi and shuttle service. From Love Field take Mockingbird
Lane west/south to I-35E north and follow the `to Denton' signs 
(i.e., stay on I35E).

<P> Airport shuttle service between Love Field and Denton costs $20 (?)
per person one way. If two or more people make reservations and are 
picked up together, one way fare for each additional passenger is 
$10 (?). The shuttle service requests reservations at least a day
in advance. Call 1-940-565-9936.

<p>  Denton taxicabs provide 24 hour service. Rates are 
approximately $45-$50 one way. Call 1-940-898-8294 or 1-940-383-4155.
(Both numbers are for the same company.)
