This page is intended to provide information for speakers and attendees of our little 
get-together this coming May. What this page will evolve into is anybody's guess at 
this stage; it is likely that in the end it will serve in large part as a clearing 
house for questions sent to the organizers, which makes a good place to start! This session 
is being organized by 
<p>
Mark Brittenham <a href="mailto:britten@unt.edu">britten@unt.edu</a><br>
Francisco Gonz&aacute;lez Acu&ntilde;a <a href="mailto:fico@math.unam.mx">fico@math.unam.mx</a><br>

The <a href="http://www.math.unt.edu">math department</a> at 
<a href="http://www.unt.edu">UNT</a> has already built a 
<a href="http://www.math.unt.edu/conf.htm">web page for the conference</a>, 
including directions to Denton from all points of the compass, and links to 
the various attractions in the vicinity of Denton, TX (translation: Dallas and
Fort Worth. North of Denton is alot of nothing all the way to Oklahoma, and
then there is more of nothing. I guess the indian reservation might have a casino up
there.... but if you're into that stuff, you should go to the Las Vegas meeting.).
This page should probably be treated as a supplement to that page, for things of
this sort.<p>

First off, you probably want to know who will be <a href="speakers.html">giving
the talks</a> in the special session.<p>

Once you decide that you can't possibly miss out on such an 
outstanding collection of talks, you will no doubt want to know how to 
<a href="directions.html">get to Denton</a>, where to <a href="lodging.html">
stay in Denton</a>, and what to <a href="stuff.html">do in Denton</a> 
(besides attend talks).<p>



<h2>Conference schedule</h2>

As of this writing, the basic schedule of the conference is planned to be:<p>

Wednesday, May 19, 7pm: opening ceremony and plenary address, followed by a reception.<br>

Thursday, May 20: Special sessions, followed by plenary talks, morning and afternoon.<br>

Friday, May 21: special sessions and plenary talk, morning, special sessions afternoon; 
the conference organizers have arranged a `Night in
Fort Worth' for the evening (see the <a href="http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2053_other.html">
AMS page</a> for more details).<br>

Saturday, May 22: Special sessions all morning, special sessions and plenary address 
in the afternoon, 
with a closing
banquet in the evening.<br>

<p>

So unlike most AMS meetings, this meeting does <b>not</b> end at noon of the last day.
Of course, you will probably want to stay over Saturday night anyway, in order to 
grab those rock-bottom airfares....<p>

The <font size=+1>official schedule of talks</font> is now out; you can look 
<a href="amsschedb.html">here</a> to find the schedule for the low-dimensional 
topology session, as well as the invited address by Francisco Gonz&aacute;lez Acu&ntilde;a,
which is slated for the last invited address slot of the conference.<p>

<h2>Where things are at UNT</h2>

The mathematics department is located on the fourth floor (which is deceiving; the 
ground floor is the second floor) of the General Academic Building (GAB - building
9 on the <a href="http://www.unt.edu/pais/map.htm">campus map</a>), where one of the 
fragments of Avenue B meets one of the fragments of Mulberry Street (neither is 
continuous). There are several sizable parking lots where Avenue C meets Mulberry;
I do not know if parking will be allowed there or not, at this time. (It might be
significant that the department's web page gives directions to the parking garage...)
It is doubtful that the talks will take place in GAB; the last thing that I 
heard suggested that the talks would take place in the university union (which might 
explain the parking garage directions). The 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2053_other.html">
meeting information</a> currently provided by the AMS does indicate that 
the bulk of the talks
will take place in the University Union (building 2 on the 
<a href="http://www.unt.edu/pais/map.htm">campus map</a>, where Prairie and Chestnut
turn into one another). The parking garage is in that Prairie/Chestnut loop. 
The science library is adjacent to GAB (in building 4 - 
Info Sciences), and
actually has a very decent selection of journals, the only problem being that their
layout is highly non-intuitive. <p>

I ought to mention that the map that those links up there send you to is a little 
out of date; there has been recent work around Ave D, Ave E and Eagle to sort of 
push all of the traffic over to Ave E.<p>

More information will be forthcoming, as events warrant!<p>
