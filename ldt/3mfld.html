MSRI has made available, as streaming 
video, many of the 
<a href="http://www.msri.org/publications/video/lectures.html">talks</a> that took place
at MSRI in the last few years, including the recent KirbyFest. You will need a copy of 
<a href="http://www.msri.org/publications/video/lectures.html">RealPlayer</a> (if you
don't already have one) in order to watch the video; the accompanying slides are
much more low-tech.<p>

Matt Brin has written some notes on 
<a href="http://math.binghamton.edu/matt/index.html">Seifert-fibered 3-manifolds</a>.<p>

I have written some notes (just under 100 pages) on foliations of 3-manifolds. 
They can be downloaded either as a (400K) <a href="foliations.dvi">Dvi</a> file or as a (640K) <a href="foliations.ps">Postscript</a> file. Unfortunately, these files do not contain the figures, which can make them very hard to read, especially towards the end. <a href="mailto:britten@math.nmsu.edu">Write</a> and I'll send you the firgures.<p>

I am in the process of putting together a WWW page on the <a href="poincare.html">Poincare conjecture</a>, based on a talk I gave at NMSU on the subject. You can go take a look at what I've put into it so far. One of these days I'll 
finish it!<p>

<a href="http://gauss.math.nara-wu.ac.jp/home/sm29041/index.htm">Tsuyoshi Kobayashi</a> has 
posted his <a href="http://gauss.math.nara-wu.ac.jp/home/sm29041/Georgia/schedule.htm">notes</a>
from the talks at the 1997 Georgia Topology Conference, as jpeg files.<p>

Craig Hodgson and Jeff Weeks have a <a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/docs/preprints/online/GCG67.html">paper</a> on length spectra at the Geometry Center.<p>

A <a href="http://www.mth.pdx.edu/Papers/">paper</a> by John Neil on Witten invariants for 3-manifolds, at Portland State.<p>

X. S. Lin's preprint <a href="ftp://math.columbia.edu/pub/lin/">archive</a>, at Columbia U.<p>

A paper on <a href="http://www.unipissing.ca/topology/tpro/v19/kelly/index.htm">Nielsen numbers for 3-manifolds</a>, in the
electronic version of the <a href="http://www.unipissing.ca/topology/tpro/">Topology Proceedings</a>.<p>

A page on computer simulations of curvature flow, towards understanding Thurston's 
<a href="http://www.math.unb.ca/~warp/java/uniform/uniform.html">geometrization 
conjecture</a>.<p>

A java-enabled page implementing <a href="http://math.ucdavis.edu/~vaughn/java/JDF/df.html">
curve straightening</a> by curvature flow.<p>

A page about <a href="http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~hjm/heegaard.html">Poul Heegaard</a>, maintained
by Hans Munkholm.<p>

Tsuyoshi Kobayashi has put his notes from talks at a meeting on 
<a href="http://gauss.math.nara-wu.ac.jp/home/sm29041/98TopPrj/schedule.htm">
laminations in 3-manifolds</a>, at Nara Women's University, on the web.<p>
