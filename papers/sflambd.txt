Subject:          Trashed manuscripts

Dear Professor Brittenham,
Yesterday I received the revised version of your manuscript "Essential
laminations ..."  Unfortunately these copies are not usable.  It appears as
though the envelope they were mailed in was, somehow, completely submerged.
So the pages, which had been completely soaked, are now stuck together and
cannot be separated.  It will be necessary, therefore, to send me two new
copies.  
Sorry about this problem,
R. Sher
P.S. It is a good thing that the figures were in a separate envelope.  Two
of them got slightly stained, but I believe that they will be alright to
send to the printer.  At least it's worth a try.  I will keep the
manuscripts, envelope, etc. if you wish to make some sort of damage claim.
The envelope was contained in a plastic wrap put on by the Post Office that
says, in part, "The enclosed was found loose in the mails or has been
damaged in handling by the Postal Service."  Your envelope was sealed, so
it is clear that the damage was caused by the Post Office.
