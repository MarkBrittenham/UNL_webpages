 <b>Background</b>
</dd></dl>A differential equation is an equation involoving an (unknown) function y and
some of its derivatives. The basic goal is to <i>solve</i> the equation, i.e., to 
determine which function or functions satisfy the equation. Differential equations
come in several types, and our techniques for solving them will differ 
depending on the type.

<p>
<i>Ordinary vs. partial:</i> If y is a function of only one variable t, then our
differential equation&nbsp;will involve only derivatives w.r.t. t, and we will call the equation an
it ordinary differential equation. If y is a function of more than one variable, then our differential equation&nbsp;
will involve partial derivatives, and we will call it a <i>partial differential equation</i>. We
will deal almost exclusively with ordinary differential equations&nbsp;in this class.

<p>
<i>Systems:</i> Sometimes the rates of change of several functions are 
inter-related, as with the populations of a predator y(t) and its prey x(t),
where x<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = ax<font face="symbol">-</font
><font face="symbol">a</font
>xy and y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = <font face="symbol">g</font
>xy <font face="symbol">-</font
> cy . We call 
this a <i>system</i> of differential equations, and its solution would involve finding both 
x(t) and y(t).

<p>
<i>Order:</i> Techniques for solving differential equations&nbsp;differ depending upon how many
derivatives of our unknown function are involved. The <i>order</i> of a 
differential equation&nbsp;is the order of the highest derivative appearing in the equation. 
The Implicit Function Theorem tells us that we can rewrite our equation so that
it equates the highest order derivative with an expression involving lower
order terms:

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<sup>(n)</sup> = F(t,y,y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>,<font face="symbol">¼</font
>,y<sup>(n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1)</sup></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>Linear vs. non-linear:</i> A differential equation&nbsp;is <i>linear</i> if it can be written as

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
a<sub>0</sub>(t)y<sup>(n)</sup>+<font face="symbol">¼</font
>+a<sub>n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1</sub>(t)y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>+a<sub>n</sub>(t)y = g(t)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
(i.e., the function F is linear in the variables y,y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>,<font face="symbol">¼</font
>,y<sup>(n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1)</sup>,
although it <b>need not</b> be linear in t). A differential equation&nbsp;is non-linear if it isn't
linear! E.g., 

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = y<sup>2</sup></td></tr></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
is non-linear, while 

<p>

y<font face="symbol">¢</font

is linear.

 <b>Solutions and Initial Value Problems</b>
</dd></dl><i>Solving</i> a differential equation&nbsp;means to determine which function or functions 
satisfy the equation. Our solutions come in two flavors: <i>explicit</i>
solutions y=y(t) which provide a function of t which satisfies the
equation, and <i>implicit</i> solutions which provide an equation
g(y,t)=0 which any explicit solution would have to satisfy. The 
idea is that we can treat g(y,t)=0 as implicitly defining y as a function
of t; given a specific value t=c for t, we solve (numerically?) 
g(y,c)=0 for y to determine the value of the solution to the differential equation&nbsp;at c.

<p>
In general, a differential equation&nbsp;y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = f(t,y) will have many solutions; but typically
one particular solution can be specified by requiring one additional condition
be met; that y take a specific value y<sub>0</sub> at a specific point t<sub>0</sub>. If we 
think of the time t<sub>0</sub> as the time at which we ``start'' our solution, then we call the
pair of equations

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = f(t,y) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y(t<sub>0</sub>)=y<sub>0</sub></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
an <i>initial value problem</i> (or <i>IVP</i>). There is a general result which
 gives conditions guaranteeing that an IVP has a solution:

<p>
If y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>=f(t,y) is a differential equation with both f and [(<font face="symbol">¶</font
>f)/(<font face="symbol">¶</font
>y)] continuous for a &lt; t &lt; b and <font face="symbol">a</font
> &lt;  y  &lt;  <font face="symbol">b</font
>,
and t<sub>0</sub> <font face="symbol">Î</font
> (a,b) and y<sub>0</sub> <font face="symbol">Î</font
> (<font face="symbol">a</font
>,<font face="symbol">b</font
>), then <i>for some</i> h &gt; 0,
the initial value problem 

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>=f(t,y) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y(t<sub>0</sub>)=y<sub>0</sub></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
has a unique solution for t <font face="symbol">Î</font
> (t<sub>0</sub><font face="symbol">-</font
>h,t<sub>0</sub>+h) .

<p>
If only f is continuous, then we can guarantee existence, but not neccesarily
uniqueness.
In general, however, the size of the interval where we can 
guarantee existence (and uniqueness) can be very small, and often depends
on the choice of initial value! For example,  for the equation

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = y<sup>2</sup></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
the righthand side is continuous everywhere (as is the partial derivative),
but the interval we can choose for the solutions y=<font face="symbol">-</font
>1/(t+c) depends on c, 
which will depend on the initial condition! And it can <i>never</i> be chosen 
to be the entire real line.

<p>
Failure to satisfy the hypotheses of the result can easily kill both 
existence and uniqueness. For example, the equation

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = y<sup>1/3</sup></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
has many solutions with the initial condition y(0)=0, such as y=0 and 
y=(2t/3)<sup>3/2</sup> .

<dd>
 <b>Direction Fields</b>
</dd></dl>In many cases, especially for first order differential equations, we can `see' what a solution
should look like without actually finding the solution. For first order
equations, y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = f(t,y), a solution y(t) will satisfy 
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>(t) = f(t,y(t)), and so we can think of f(t,y) as giving the <i>slope</i>
of the tangent line to the graph of y(t) at the point (t,y(t)). But since the function f
is already known, we can draw small line segments at `every' point of the t-y plane
with slope f(t,y) at the point (t,y); this is called the
<i>direction field</i> for our differential equation. A solution to our differential equation&nbsp;is
simply a function whose graph is tangent to each of these line segments at every
point along the graph. Thinking of the direction field as a velocity vector field
(always pointing to the right), our solution is then the path of a particle being
pushed along by the velocity vector field. From this point of view it is not 
hard to believe that <i>every</i> (first order ordinary) differential equation&nbsp;has a solution, in 
fact many solutions; you just drop a particle in and watch where it goes. <i>Where</i>
you drop it is important (it changes where it goes), which really is what gives rise to the
notion of an <i>initial value problem</i>; we seek to find the specific solution
with the additional <i>initial value</i> y(t<sub>0</sub>)=y<sub>0</sub>.

<p>
Sketching the slope field for the differential equation&nbsp;y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = f(t,y) can be aided by using <i>nullclines</i>
(= the points where f(t,y)=0; we draw horizontal lines there) and <i>isoclines</i>
(= the points where f(t,y)=c for a fixed constant c). See the handout from class for 
more specifics of this technique.

<dd>
 <b>Separable Equations</b>
</dd></dl>There is a class of first order equations for which we can readily
find solutions by integration; there are the <i>separable</i> equations. A
differential equation&nbsp;is separable if it can be written as

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = A(t)B(y)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
This allows us to `separate the variables' and integrate with respect to dy and dt
to get a solution:

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
 [&nbsp;1/B(y)]dy = A(t) dt ; integrate both sides</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
In the end, our solutions look like F(y) = G(t) + c, so it defines y
<i>implicitly</i> as a function of t , rather than explicitly. In some cases
we can invert F to get an explicit solution, but often we cannot.

<p>
For example, the separable equation y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = ty<sup>2</sup> , y(1)=2 has solution

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
 <font face="symbol">ò</font
>[&nbsp;dy/(y<sup>2</sup>)] = <font face="symbol">ò</font
>t dt + c</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
so solving the integrals we get (<font face="symbol">-</font
>1/y) = (t<sup>2</sup>/2)+c, or y = <font face="symbol">-</font
>2/(t<sup>2</sup>+2c) ; 
setting y=2 when t=1 gives c=<font face="symbol">-</font
>1 .

 <b>Linear Equations</b>
</dd></dl>Perhaps the most straightforward sort of differential equation&nbsp;to solve is the <i>first order
linear ordinary differential equation</i> 

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = a(t)y+b(t)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
We will typically (following tradition) write such equations in <i>standard form</i> as

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>+ p(t)y = g(t)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (**)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
For example, near the earth and in the presence of air resistance, the
velocity v of a falling object obeys the differential equation&nbsp;v<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = <font face="symbol">-</font
>g <font face="symbol">-</font
>kv, 
where g and k are (positive) constants.

<p>
There is a general technique for solving such equations, by trying to think of the
left-hand side of the equation as the derivative of a single function. In form it
looks like the derivative of a product, and by introducing an <i>integrating factor</i> <font face="symbol">m</font
>(t),
we can actually arrange this. Writing

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
(<font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)y)<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = <font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)(y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>+p(t)y)) = <font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)g(t)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
we find that (where exp(blah) means e raised to the power `blah')

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<font face="symbol">m</font
>(t) = exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t) dt)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
and so

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)y = <font face="symbol">ò</font
><font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)g(t) dt = <font face="symbol">ò</font
>(exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t) dt)) g(t) dt +c</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
which we can then solve for y.

<p>
Putting this all together, we find that the solutions to (**) are given by

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y = e<sup><font face="symbol">-</font
><font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t)&nbsp;dt</sup>(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>e<sup><font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t)&nbsp;dt</sup> g(t)&nbsp;dt + c)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
For example, the differential equation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ty<font face="symbol">¢</font
><font face="symbol">-</font
>y = t<sup>2</sup>+1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, after being rewritten in 
standard form as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y<font face="symbol">¢</font
><font face="symbol">-</font
>(1/t)y = t+(1/t), has homogeneous solution

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<sub>h</sub>=exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>1/t dt)=exp(lnt) = t</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
so we have 

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y=t(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>1+1/t<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;dt) = t(t<font face="symbol">-</font
>(1/t)+c)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
and so our solutions are y=t<sup>2</sup><font face="symbol">-</font
>1+ct, where c is a constant.

<p>
But what is c ? Or solution is actually a <i>family</i> of solutions; a 
particular solution (i.e., a particular value for c) can be found from 
an initial value y(t<sub>0</sub>) =y<sub>0</sub>. For example, if we wished to solve
the initial value problem 

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
ty<font face="symbol">¢</font
><font face="symbol">-</font
>y = t<sup>2</sup>+1 , y(2)=5</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
we can plug t=2 and y=5 into our general solution to obtain c=1 .

 <b>Application: Mixing Problems</b>
</dd></dl>In many instances, the rate of change of a quantity can be best 
analyzed by treating the factors that make the quantity go up 
separately from those that make it go down; each can often be readily understood 
in isolation. We can then build a differential equation modeling the 
behavior of the quantity y=y(t) as

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = (things that make y go up) <font face="symbol">-</font
> (things that make y go down)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
As a basic example, we have mixing problems. The basic setup has 
a solution of a known concentration mixing at a known rate with a 
solution in a vat, while the mixed solution is poured off at a known rate. 
The problem is to find the function which gives concentration in the vat
at time t. It turns out that it is much easier to find a differential equation&nbsp;which describes the amount of solute (e.g., salt) in the
solution (e.g., water), rather than the concentration.

<p>
If the concentration pouring in is A, at a rate of N, while the 
solution is pouring out at rate M with concentration A(t)=
x(t)/V(t), then if the initial volume is V<sub>0</sub>, we can 
compute V(t)=V<sub>0</sub>+(N<font face="symbol">-</font
>M)t . The change in the amount x(t) of
solute can be computed as (rate falling in)<font face="symbol">-</font
>(rate falling out),
which is

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
x<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = AN <font face="symbol">-</font
> A(t)M = 
 AN<font face="symbol">-</font
>[&nbsp;x/(V<sub>0</sub>+(N<font face="symbol">-</font
>M)t)]M</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
This is a linear equation, and so we can solve it using our 
techniques above. 

<p>
We can also deal with a succession of mixing problems, the output of one 
becoming the input of the next, by treating them one at a time; the only 
change in the setup above is that the incoming concentration for the
next vat (to solve for x<sub>i+1</sub>(t)) would be the concentration x<sub>i</sub>(t)/V<sub>i</sub>(t)
found by solving the equation for the previous vat.

<dd>
 <b>Population Models</b>
</dd></dl>Another situation where this kind of analysis proves successful is in modeling
population growth. The
idea is that if y is the population at time t, then

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = (birth rate) <font face="symbol">-</font
> (death rate)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Typically, the birth rate is proportional to the population,
i.e. is ry, while the death rate is either modeled as being proportional 
to the population (Malthusian model)
or is a sum (logistic model); one part is proportional to the 
population (death by ``natural causes''), the other is proportional to the 
square of the population (this typically represents contact
between individuals,arising from competition for food, overcrowding,
etc.), i.e., is ky<sup>2</sup> . Put together, and combining the two terms proportional
to population, we obtain 

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = ry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the Malthusian model, and</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = ry<font face="symbol">-</font
>ky<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the logistic model</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Both equations are separable, and so we can use phase diagrams to understand 
their long-term behavior (see below), as
well as finding explicit solutions (using partial fractions, for 
the logistic equation).

 <b>Heating and Cooling</b>
</dd></dl><i>Newton's Law of Cooling:</i> This states that the rate of
change of the temperature
T(t) of an object is proportional to the difference between
its temperature and the ambient temperature of the air around it.
The constant of proportionality depends upon the particular
object (and the medium, e.g., air or water) it is in. In other
words,

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
T<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = k(A<font face="symbol">-</font
>T)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Since a cold object will warm up, and a warm object will cool
down, this means that the constant k should be positive. Writing
the equation as

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
T<font face="symbol">¢</font
>+kT=kA</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
we find the solution (after solving the IVP)

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
T(t) = A+(T(0)<font face="symbol">-</font
>A)e<sup><font face="symbol">-</font

<p>
Typically, k is not given, but can be determined by
knowing the temperature at some other time t<sub>1</sub>, by 
plugging into the equation above and solving for k.

 <b>Autonomous Equations and the Phase Diagram</b>
</dd></dl>A differential equation is called <i>autonomous</i> if
the function f(t,y) is really a function f(y) only of the
variable y. We will learn how to solve such equations below; 
but we can
learn alot about the solutions to such an equation simply 
by understanding the graph of f(y) .

<p>
One feature of the solutions is that we can translate in
time and get another solution; if y(t) is a 
solution to y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = f(y), then so is z(t)=y(t+c)
for any constant c, as can be verified by plugging z into
the differential equation. This can also be verified geometrically, using
the direction field approach. For an autonomous equation, 
the slope of the direction field is always the same along
horizontal lines (since it depends on y, not t), and so if
we pick up a solution curve, tangent to the direction field,
and translate it in the horizontal direction, it will <i>still</i>
be everywhere tangent to the direction field, and so is also a 
solution.

<p>
The key to understanding solutions to such equations
y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>=f(y) is to find <i>equilibrium solutions</i>, that
is, solutions y = constant =c . Such solutions have derivative
0, and so for such solutions we must have f(c)=0. The basic
idea is that these equilibrium solutions tell us a great deal about 
the behavior of <i>every</i> solution to the differential equation.

<p>
If the function f(y) is continuous, then between the zeroes
of f (i.e., the equilibrium
solutions of the differential equation) f has all the same sign, and so for the 
solutions, y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> has the same sign, so y(t) is either 
always 
increasing or always decreasing. It cannot <i>cross</i>
the equilibrium solutions, since this would violate
the uniqueness of solutions to our differential equation. (Here we assume
that the derivative of f is also continuous.) If a
solution curve becomes asymptotic to a horizontal line, that 
line must <i>be</i> an equilibrium solution, because
the tangent lines along our solution must be becoming 
horizontal, i.e., f(y(t))=f(y) is approaching 0 = f(limit
of y(t)). 

<p>
Therefore, the structure of the solutions is very simple; between
consecutive equilibrium solutions, the solutions increase or
decrease monotonically from one equilibrium to the other.
This allows us to classify equilibrium solutions as one of
three kinds: <i>stable equilibria</i>, where nearby
solutions all converge <i>back</i> to the equilibrium, 
<i>unstable equilibria</i>, where nearby
solutions all diverge away from the equilibrium, and
<i>semistable equilibria</i> or <i>nodes</i>, where on one side the
solutions converge back, and on the other they diverge away.

<p>
The easiest way to assemble this data is to plot the roots of f
on a number line (called the <i>phase diagram</i>, and then determine 
the sign of f in the intervals
in between. Where it is positive, solutions move to the right 
(i.e., up), while where it is negative they move left. Marking
these as arrows, a stable equilibrium has arrows on both sides
pointing towards it, and an unstable equilibrium has both
arrows pointing away.

 <b>Newtonian Mechanics: Velocity/Acceleration Models</b>
</dd></dl>If we wish to model the motion of an object, whose position at time t is given by x(t), then

When we can understand these forces, in terms of t and v, we can build a
first order differential equation, which we can then bring our techniques to bear to solve.
Typical forces include:

<p>
gravity: F<sub>g</sub> = mg or F<sub>g</sub> = <font face="symbol">-</font

as down (giving +) or up (giving <font face="symbol">-</font

<p>
air resisitance: this is typically modeled either as F<sub>a</sub>=<font face="symbol">-</font

external force: F<sub>e</sub>=g(t) ; this represents a force that ``follows along'' the object and tries to push 
it in a direction that is ``pre-programmed'' in time.

With these sorts of forces, we get a general equation

which we can solve by the methods we have developed. For example, ignoring external forces and 
assume the positive direction is ``down'', we have the initial value problem

 <b>The Approximation Method of Euler</b>
</dd></dl>Most first order equations cannot be solved by the methods
we will present here; the function f(y,t) is too complicated. 
For such equations, the best we can often
do is to <i>approximate</i> the solutions, using numerical techniques.
One method is the <i>tangent line method</i>, also known as <i>Euler's method</i>. 
The idea is
that our differential equation y<font face="symbol">¢</font
> = f(t,y) tells us
the slope of the tangent line at every point of our solution, 
and the tangent line can be used to approximate the graph
of a function, at least close to the point of tangency. In other
words, for a solution to our differential equation,

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y(t)  <font face="symbol">»</font
> y(t<sub>0</sub>)+y<font face="symbol">¢</font
>(t<sub>0</sub>)(t<font face="symbol">-</font
>t<sub>0</sub>) = y<sub>0</sub>+f(t<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>)(t<font face="symbol">-</font
>t<sub>0</sub>)</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
for t<font face="symbol">-</font
>t<sub>0</sub> small. If we wish to approximate y(t) for a value of t
far away from our initial value t<sub>0</sub>, we use
the above idea in several steps. 
We cut up the interval into n pieces of length h (called the
<i>stepsize</i>), and then 
set

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<sub>1</sub>=y<sub>0</sub>+f(t<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>)h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t<sub>1</sub>=t<sub>0</sub>+h</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<sub>2</sub>=y<sub>1</sub>+f(t<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t<sub>2</sub>=t<sub>1</sub>+h</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
y<sub>3</sub>=y<sub>2</sub>+f(t<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t<sub>3</sub>=t<sub>2</sub>+h</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
and continue until we reach y<sub>n</sub>, which will be our approximation
to y(t)=y(t<sub>n</sub>) . Each step can be thought of as a mid-course
correction, using information about the direction field at each stage
to determine which way the solution is tending.

<p>
Calculus teaches us that at each stage the error introduced
is approximately proportional to the square of h. So with a
stepsize half as large, we will require twice as many steps, but
each introduces an error only about one-fourth as large, so overall
we get an error only half as large. This leads us to conclude
that as the stepsize goes to 0, the error between our approximate solution
y<sub>n</sub> and y(t<sub>n</sub>) goes to 0.
