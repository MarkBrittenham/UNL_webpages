problems assigned, dates for exams, etc.)

<b>Office Hours:</b> (tentatively) Mo 11:00-12:00, Tu 2:00 - 3:00, We 12:00-1:00, 
and Th 1:00 - 2:00, and whenever you can find me in my office and I'm not 
horrendously busy. You are also quite welcome to make an appointment
for any other time; this is easiest to arrange just before or 
after class.

<b>Text:</b> <i>Calculus</i>, 
by Smith and Minton (McGraw-Hill, 2nd edition).
<p>
<p><br>
This course, as the name is meant to imply, is a continuation of Calculus 
1 and 2. Our goal is to redo much of what was covered in the previous courses, 
for functions having <i>several</i> variables (whatever they are).
Our basic goal will be to work through the chapters of the book not covered in
Calculus 1 and 2:
<p>
<p>
(Ch. 9, Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates)
<p>
Ch. 10, Vectors and the Geometry of Space
<p>
Ch. 11, Vector-valued Functions
<p>
Ch. 12, Functions of Several Variables and Partial Differentiation
<p>
Ch. 13, Multiple Integrals
<p>
Ch. 14, Vector Calculus
<p>
<p><br>
<b>Homework</b> will be assigned from each section, as we finish it. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics, we learn best by doing (again and again and ...). Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you should make sure you are understanding the
process of finding the solution, on your own - after 
all, you get to bring only one brain to exams (and it can't be someone 
else's). For the same reason, I also recommend that you try working 
each problem on your own, first. 
<p>
<p>
Homework will be collected two class 
periods after it is assigned (e.g. Monday's assignment is due Thursday,
Wednesday's is due Friday, ...), graded, and returned. Homework will be 
worth 120 points towards your final grade. Late homeworks will be recorded as turned 
in, but not graded.
<p>
<p>
In addition, we will have one significantly larger assignment. This <b>project</b>
will be assigned at the begining of March, and will be collected several weeks later. 
You may choose to work on the project in groups of up to three, with one write-up
turned in for the group, or you may choose to work on it individually. It will 
count 40 points towards your final grade.
<p>


<p>
<b>Midterm exams</b> will be given three times during the 
semester, in the evening, approximately every four weeks - the specific dates will 
be announced in class well in advance (likely candidates: early February, 
mid-March, mid-April). Each exam will count 100 points toward your grade. 
You can take a 
make-up exam only if there are compelling reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you to miss an exam. Make-up 
exams tend to be harder than the originals (because make-up exams 
are harder to write!). 
<p>
<p>
Finally, there will be a regularly scheduled <b>final exam</b>, on 
Tuesday, May 4, from 7:30am to 9:30am. 
It will cover the entire course, (probably) with a slight emphasis 
on material covered after the last midterm exam. It will count 
140 points toward your grade.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>Your course grade</b> will therefore be calculated based upon a total of
120 + 40 + 3&times;100 + 140 = 600 points,
and will be converted to a letter grade based partly on the overall average of the
class. However, a score of 90% or better will guarantee some kind of <b>A</b>, 80%
or better at least some sort of <b>B</b>, 70% or better at least a flavor of 
<b>C</b>, and 60% or 
better at least a <b>D</b>.
<p>
<p>

<p><br><p><br>
In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. 
(In particular, a proper mastery of the material from Calculus I and II is 
central to making your Calculus III experience bearable.) 
Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make 
<U>sure</U> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's 
<U>your</U> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, and to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's alot easier to read 50 pages of the text in a week 
than it is in a day. Try to do some mathematics every single day. (I do.)
<b>Class attendance</b> is probably your best way to insure that you will keep 
up with the material, and make sure that you understand all of the
concepts. I will not be taking attendance; I expect that you will simply 
see the wisdom of attending class, for yourselves.

<b>Departmental Grading Appeals Policy:</b> Students who believe their
academic evaluation has been prejudiced or capricious have recourse for appeals 
to (in order) the instructor, the departmental chair, the departmental appeals 
committee, and the college appeals committee.
