\ctln{\bf Pop quizlette:}

\ssk

\nidt The following quizlette counts for nothing, and is intended to provide no indication
about what prior knowledge the instructor expects you to bring to this course,
nor what the instructor expects to cover. People can bring very
different backgrounds to this class; this is just a broad attempt to sketch what
concepts you
might have encountered up to now.

\msk

\nidt Rate each of the following phrases on a scale from 1 to 5, where 

\ssk

1 $\approx$ `` I was reading about that this morning '', 

3 $\approx$ `` I've seen that before '', 

5 $\approx$ `` is that really a word/phrase? ''.

\ssk

\nidt Don't spend more 
than about 8 seconds on each; first 
impressions are the important thing.
Besides, there are no wrong answers....
