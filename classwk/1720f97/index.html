<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 1720 class
for Fall, 1997. Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.html">homework assignments</a>, 
dates for <a href="exam.html">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams,
an html-ized copy of the <a href="summ.html">course summary</a>, and anything else that
might come up.</center>

<center>Some links that might be of general interest:</center>
<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/sosmath/">SOS Math</a> at the Univ. of 
Texas at El Paso offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://www.ping.be/~ping1339/hp.htm">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

A site called <a href'"http://www.netsrq.com/~hahn/calculus.html">Karl's Calculus Tutor</a> 
currently covers most of what would qualify as first-semester calculus, and some of our
second semester, as well.<p>

<a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/">Dan Sloughter</a> has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>
