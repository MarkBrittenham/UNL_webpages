\item{9.} A sphere with 4 punctures has a decomposition into four ideal triangles. 
Use this to describe all of the complete hyperbolic structures on a 4–punctured sphere,
in terms of "translation coordinates" along the edges of the triangles. How many
independent parameters do we have?

\item{10.}  Show that in hyperbolic 3-space $\bbh^3$ for any two geodesics 
$\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ that do not share a common
endpoint on the sphere at infinity there is a third geodesic $\gamma_3$ that 
meets both $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ and is perpendicular to both. [As usual,
pick an isometry to make them look as nice as possible, first...]

\item{11.} Show that every geodesic in $\bbh^3$ is the intersection of two totally
geodesic planes in $\bbh^3$, and, conversely, that the intersection of two
totally goedesic planes (if non-empty!) is a geodesic in $\bbh^3$.

\item{12.} Given $z_1,z_2,z_3,w_1,w_2,w_3\in\bbc$, under what conditions is there a fractional linear
transformation $\dsp f(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ with $f(z_i)=w_i$ for $i=1,2,3$ ? 
Under what conditions is the map unique? [Try to directly write one down and see when you fail...]

\item{13.} (We found all of the isometries.) Use the fact that the geodesics of $\bbh^3$ (in the upper
halfspace model) are the semicircles perpendicular to $\bbr^2\times\{0\}$ and vertical lines to show that
the isometries of $\bbh^3$ are precisely the fractional linear transformations of Problem \#12 (composed
with $(x,y,z)\mapsto (-x,y,z)$ to get the orientation-reversing maps). That is, show that "behavior
at a single point" determines an isometry uniquely, and all such behaviors are captured by these maps.

\item{14.} Prove that if $M$ is any 3-manifold obtained by gluing the faces of ideal tetrahedra, and the link of every 
vertex of the associated complex (by including the vertices) is a torus, then 
the number of 1-cells in the (ideal) triangulation of $M$ equals the number of 3-cells
(i.e., tetrahedra) in the triangulation. [Hint: Think about counting (fractions of) things 
in the links of the vertices, knowing what the Euler characteristics should be.]

\item{15.} Find a decomposition of the complement $X$ of the knot $6_3$ in $S^3$ into ideal tetrahedra, 
and write down the shape parameters and shape gluing equations for a hyperbolic structure on $X$.
(See Purcell's notes in the "public" directory, section 5.1, for a refresher on decomposing $X$, 
if you need it.)

\item{16.} In Purcell's notes, page 45, she gives the following ideal tetrahedral decomposition
of the complement $X$ of the knot $6_1$:

\item{\spc} Use this to give the shape gluing equations for the hyperbolic structure(s) on $X$.
Draw the induced triangulation on the link of the ideal vertex, and give the corresponding
completeness equations for a hyperbolic structure on $X$.
