This page describes the contents of the <a href="public">public/</a> repository for the
class, and gives links to other resources (mostly, other people's courses/course notes) on the
web related to the topics we will discuss.

<p>

Thurston's hugely influential notes, from 1979-80, have been rendered into TeX and
are <a href="http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/">available on the web</a> from MSRI.<p>

A scanned pdf of Thurston's original type-written notes (i.e., how they were originally
distributed) are 
<a href="https://ia802804.us.archive.org/22/items/ThurstonTheGeometryAndTopologyOfThreeManifolds/Thurston__The_Geometry_And_Topology_Of_Three-Manifolds.pdf">
available from <a href="https://archive.org/index.php">The Internet Archive</a>.<p>

Note that Chapters 10 and 12 of these notes have never actually existed...<p>

<p>

Bruno Martelli has a 
<a href="http://people.dm.unipi.it/martelli/didattica/matematica/2014/Hyperbolic%20geometry.pdf">
draft of a book</a> on hyperbolic geometry in dimensions 2 and 3. <p>

Jessica Purcell has notes on <a href="http://users.monash.edu/~jpurcell/papers/hyp-knot-theory.pdf">
hyperbolic knot theory</a>, based on a course taught in 2010.<p>

Will Adkisson wrote a nice exposition on 
<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2014/REUPapers/Adkisson.pdf">
geodesics in hyperbolic space</a> for an REU i 2014.<p>

<p>

Nearly everybody seems to have taught a course on material not wholly unlike our class.
And many have their own pages of resources, or have made their lecture notes available.
Some of the more notable ones I have found are below.
