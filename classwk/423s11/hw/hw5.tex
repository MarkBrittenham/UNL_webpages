\item{17.} [BC\#2.26.7] Let the function $f(z)=u(x,y)+\ii v(x,y)$ be analytic in a domain $D$ and 
consider the families of level curves \hfill

\ssk

\ctln{${\Cal U}=\{\{(x,y) : u(x,y)=c_1\} : c_1\in\bbc\}$ and 
${\Cal V}=\{\{(x,y) : v(x,y)=c_2\} : c_2\in\bbc\}$.}

\ssk

\item{} Show that wherever they meet, the curves
in ${\Cal U}$ are \underbar{orthogonal} to the curves in ${\Cal V}$. That is, the slopes
of the two curves, at a point of intersection, are negative reciprocals. 

\msk

\item{} [Hint: for each curve
treat it as implicitly defining $y$ as a function of $x$ and use the multivariate chain rule
to, e.g., differentiate both sides of $u(x,y(x))=c_1$ w.r.t. $x$.]

\bsk

\item{18.} [BC\#3.29.12] For $z=x+y\ii$, write $\text{Re}(e^{1/z})$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. Explain why
this function is harmonic in every domain $D$ that does not contain $0$.
 
\bsk

\item{19.} [BC\#3.31.5] Show that:

\ssk

\item{(a):} the set of values of $\log(\ii^{1/2})$ is $\dl \big(n+{{1}\over{4}}\big)\pi\ii$ for $n$ any integer,
and that the same is true for $\dl{{1}\over{2}}\log(\ii)$

\msk

\item{(b):} the set of values of $\log(\ii^2)$ is \underbar{not} the same as the set of values for $2\log(\ii)$.

\bsk

\item{20.} For $z=x+y\ii$, does $1^z$ always equal $1$ ?
