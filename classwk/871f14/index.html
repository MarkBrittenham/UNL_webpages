The <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/topology/">Topology Atlas</a> is a huge database of 
(mostly research-level) information on
topology. It includes a page of <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/topology/educ.htm">lecture notes</a> in 
topology, for example.<p>

<!--
There is a fairly wide ranging discussion of 
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/54-XX.html">General Topology</a>
(i.e., point-set topology), which is part of a larger group of pages on the various
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/beginners.html#GEO">
divisions of mathematics</a>.<p>
-->


More generally, there is the rather entertaining <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/">
Interactive Mathematics Miscellany</a> page. My favorite little tidbit so far has been
"[By the extreme value theorem,] for any object there is a distance at which it 
looks its best." (It took me a little while to figure out why that was actually true.)<p>

<!-- Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.htm">homework assignments</a>, -->
<!-- dates for <a href="exam.htm">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams, -->
<!-- an html-ized copy of the <a href="summ.htm">course summary</a>, and anything else that -->
<!-- might come up. -->
