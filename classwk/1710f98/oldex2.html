 <b>1.</b> A hot air balloon is rising vertically, at a constant rate 
of 5 feet per second. 50 feet from where the balloon took off, you 
are standing and holding a rope that is tied to the balloon (see 
figure). How fast is the rope passing through your hands when the 
balloon is 100 feet off of the ground? (In other words, how fast 
is the length of the rope between you and the balloon changing?)
(25 pts.)

 <b>2.</b> Let f(x) be the function 
<p>
<p>

<center>
 f(x) = [(x<sup>2</sup>+3)/(x+1)] = (x<sup>2</sup>+3)(x+1)<sup>-1</sup> = x-1+[4/(x+1)] = x-1+4(x+1)<sup>-1</sup></center><br>
<p>
<p>
(Note: these are all the <b>same</b> function!)
<p>
<p>
(a) Determine the intervals over which f is increasing and decreasing (12 pts.).
<p>
 (Note: one of the versions of the function is easier to differentiate than the others!)
<p>

<p>
(b) Determine the intervals over which f is concave up and concave down (12 pts.).
<p>
<p>
(c) Find all vertical asymptotes for f; determine the 
appropriate limits. Find the limits of f(x) as x<font face="symbol">®</font
><font face="symbol">±</font
><font face="symbol">¥</font
> (6 pts.)
<p>
<p>
(d) Using the information from (a)-(c), sketch a graph of the function y = f(x)

 (5 pts.)

 <b>3.</b> You are given 500 feet of fencing to build a rectangular
pen, which will be subdivided into 6 pieces, by adding two 
vertical and one horizontal fence lines (see figure). What is 
the largest area that can be enclosed? (25 pts.)
