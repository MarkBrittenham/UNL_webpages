<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 203 class
for Spring, 1999. Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.html">homework assignments</a>, 
dates for <a href="exam.html">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams,
an html-ized copy of the <a href="fd2.html">course summary</a>, and anything else that
might come up.</center>
<p>
<center><b>Some links related to material from the course:</b></center>
<p>
A site at the University of Tennessee at Martin includes some pages on 
<a href="http://www.utm.edu/departments/math/graph/">graph theory</a>, including
a tutorial on Euler and Hamiltonian circuits. It includes an interesting story
on the origin of the phrase `Hamiltonian circuit'.<p>

An explanation (using too much mathematical notation?) of 
<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m4408/gtln16.html">
minimal spanning trees</a> (I'm looking for a better one..)<p>

Another page on <a href="http://watson2.cs.binghamton.edu/~jlubinsk/cs333/cs333_2.html">
minimal spanning trees</a>...still too much math...<p>

A page about <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~graham/cs2022/greedy/index.html">
greedy algorithms</a>, e.g., Kruskal's algorithm; again, a bit too much notation...<p>


<center><b>Some links that might be of general interest:</b></center>
<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/sosmath/">SOS Math</a> at the Univ. of 
Texas at El Paso offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://www.ping.be/~ping1339/hp.htm">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

<a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/">Dan Sloughter</a> has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>

Forget a geometry formula? Check <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~mcenter/geometry.html">
this page</a> at Trinity College.<p>

A Java-enabled page for generating <a href="http://frankenstein.worldweb.net/donovan/cv/">
Pascal's triangle</a> (or rather, the last two digits of each entry, which is good enough
through the 24th line). What's the pattern of the even numbers in the triangle?!<p>
