<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 106 class
for Fall, 2007. Here you may find lists of <a href="hw">homework assignments</a>, 
information about <a href="exam">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams,
an html-ized copy of the <a href="106fd.html">course summary</a> 
(as well as <a href="106fd.ps">Postscript</a> and <a href="106fd.pdf">PDF</a>), and anything else that
might come up.</center>

<center><b>Some calculus links:</b></center>

A site called <a href="http://www.netsrq.com/~hahn/calculus.html">Karl's Calculus Tutor</a> 
currently covers most of what would qualify as first-semester calculus, and some of the
second semester, as well.<p>

<p>

<center><b>Some (mathematical) links that might be of general interest:</b></center>
<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/sosmath/">SOS Math</a> at the Univ. of 
Texas at El Paso offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://www.ping.be/~ping1339/hp.htm">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

<a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/">Dan Sloughter</a> has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>

Forget a geometry formula? Check <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~mcenter/geometry.html">
this page</a> at Trinity College.<p>

A Java-enabled page for generating <a href="http://frankenstein.worldweb.net/donovan/cv/">
Pascal's triangle</a> (or rather, the last two digits of each entry, which is good enough
through the 24th line). What's the pattern of the even numbers in the triangle?!<p>
