<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 107 class
for Spring, 2010. Here you may find lists of <a href="hw">homework assignments</a>, 
information about <a href="exam">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams,
the course summary ,
as <a href="107fd.ps">Postscript</a> and <a href="107fd.pdf">PDF</a>, and anything else that
might come up.</center> 
<p>
<a href="inclass"><b>Solutions and handouts</b></a> handed out in class.
<p>
This class starts where Math 106 (Calculus 1) ends; go <a href="oldreview">here</a>
to find some review sheets of the material covered in Math 106.

<p>
The <b>group project</b> for the class can be found here, in <a href="inclass/107Proj-SP-10c.ps">Postscript</a>
or <a href="inclass/107Proj-SP-10c.pdf">PDF</a> format. It is due Friday, April 16.

<center><b>Some calculus links:</b></center>

A site called <a href="http://www.karlscalculus.org/">Karl's Calculus Tutor</a> 
currently covers most of what would qualify as first-semester calculus, and some of the
second semester, as well.<p>

<p>

<center><b>Some (mathematical) links that might be of general interest:</b></center>
<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.sosmath.com/">SOS Math</a> 
offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://home.scarlet.be/~ping1339/index.html">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

Dan Sloughter has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>

Forget a geometry formula? Check <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~mcenter/geometry.html">
this page</a> at Trinity College.<p>

<!--
A Java-enabled page for generating <a href="http://frankenstein.worldweb.net/donovan/cv/">
Pascal's triangle</a> (or rather, the last two digits of each entry, which is good enough
through the 24th line). What's the pattern of the even numbers in the triangle?!<p>
