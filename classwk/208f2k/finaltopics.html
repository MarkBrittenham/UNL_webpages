<b>11. Functions of several variables</b>
<p>
<p>
Find the domain; sketch cross-sections, sketch contour diagrams/level curves.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>12. Vectors</b>
<p>
<p>
Go between [i\vec],[j\vec],[k\vec] notation and coordinate notation, Compute length,
dot product, cross product. Compute projection of one vector onto another. Find
equation of the plane passing through three points; find equation of a plane from a
point and normal vector.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>13. Differentiation</b>
<p>
<p>
Compute partial derivatives, gradient, equation for tangent plane to the graph, higher
order partial derivatives. Compute the partial derivatives of a composite function
using the Chain Rule for several variables. Remember that mixed partials are equal, and
gradient vectors are perpendicular to level curves. Find the quadratic approximation to
a function of two variables (Taylor polynomial).
<p>
<p><br>
<b>14. Optimization</b>
<p>
<p>
Find the critical points of a function of two or three variables. Use the <i>Hessian</i>
of f, f<sub>xx</sub>f<sub>yy</sub>-(f<sub>xy</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, to distinguish between local max's, local mins, and saddle
points. Find the global max or min over a domain (unconstrained optimization).
Find the max or min for one function lying on the level curve of another (constrained
optimization - Lagrange multipliers).
<p>
<p><br>
<b>15. Integration</b>
<p>
<p>
Understand that integrals are <i>sums</i>. Compute the integral of a function of two 
variables over a region lying between two curves. Know how to switch from dy dx 
to dx dy. Compute the triple integral over a region lying under a graph and over
a region in the plane. Determine the `shadow' in the plane of a region in 3-space. 
Use change of variables and the Jacobian to simplify a multiple integral, by 
simplifying the
region we integrate over. Integrate a function over a cicular region using polar 
coordinates. Integrate a
function over a spherical region using cylindrical and spherical coordinates.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>16. Parametrized curves</b>
<p>
<p>
Sketch a curve from a parametrization; parametrize a circle and a line through
a pair of points. Compute the velocity, acceleration, and length of a 
parametrized curve. Compute, from velocity and initial point, the parametrization
of a curve.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>17. Vector fields</b>
<p>
<p>
Understand vector fields as a choice of vector at each point of a domain. Sketch 
vector fields, e.g., gradient vector fields.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>18. Line integrals</b>
<p>
<p>
Undertand line integral as the sum of dot products of [F\vec] with velocity vectors. 
Compute using a parametrization of a curve, and using the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals:
the integral of a gradient field depends only on the endpoints. Know that gradient fields are
path independent. know that path independent vector fields are gradient fields. Compute a
potential function by integrating coordinates. Compute the curl of a vector
field; use Green's Theorem to compute a line integral over a closed curve (oriented
correctly) as the integral of the curl over the region it bounds. Use to compute
the area of a region by integrating a field with curl 1 around the boundary.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>19. Flux integrals</b>
<p>
<p>
Understand flux integral as the rate of flow of a fluid through a surface S
whose velocity vectors are [F\vec]. Understand as integrating 
[F\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>[n\vec] dA where [n\vec] is the unit normal to the surface.
Know in general that [n\vec] dA can be computed using a parametrization
(x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t)), as (x<sub>s</sub>,y<sub>s</sub>,z<sub>s</sub>)&times;(x<sub>t</sub>,y<sub>t</sub>,z<sub>t</sub>).
Compute flux integrals in the special cases that S is a piece
of the graph of a function ([n\vec] dA = (-f<sub>x</sub>,-f<sub>y</sub>,1), integrate over 
shadow of S in the plane), a piece of a cylinder (using cylindrical coordinates),
or a piece of a sphere (using spherical coordinates).

<b>20. Calculus of vector fields</b>
<p>
<p>
Compute the divergence of a vector field, understand it as the flux density
of the field. Use the Divergence Theorem to compute a flux integral over the boundary
of a region as a triple integral over the region. 
<p>
Compute the curl of a vector field, understand it as
the circulation density of the field. Use Stokes' Theorem to compute the line integral
of [F\vec] over a closed curve C as the flux integral of curl([F\vec]) over
a surface with boundary C. Compute the flux integral of a 
divergence-free vector field (i.e., a curl field) as the flux integral of the 
field over another surface with the same boundary.
