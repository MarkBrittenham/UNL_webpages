 <b>The divergence of a vector field</b></DD></DL>
In terms of the coordinates [F\vec] = (F<sub>1</sub>,F<sub>2</sub>,F<sub>3</sub>) of a vector field, the divergence is
<p>

<center>div(F) = (F<sub>1</sub>)<sub>x</sub>+(F<sub>2</sub>)<sub>y</sub>+(F<sub>3</sub>)<sub>z</sub></center><br>
<p>
It can be identified with the <i>flux density</i> of the vector field [F\vec] at a 
point P: this should be though of as the flux integral of F through a tiny
box around the point P. This measures the extent to which the vector field is `expanding',
at each point.
<p>
<p>
div(F) = the limit as the side length goes to 0, of the flux through the sides of a box 
centered at P, divided by the volume of the box.
<p>
<p>
A vector field F is <i>divergence-free</i> if div(F) = 0. For example, F = (y,z,x)
is divergence free, but F = (x,y,z) is not; div(F) = 3.
<p>
Some formulas that can help to calculate divergence:
<p>
<p>

<center>div(fF) = (<font face="symbol">Ñ</font
>f)<font face="symbol">·</font
>F + f&#183;(divF)</center><br>
<p>

<center>div(F&times;G) = (curl F)<font face="symbol">·</font
>G - F<font face="symbol">·</font
>(curlG) in 3-space</center><br>
<p>

<center>div(curl([F\vec])) = 0 in 3-space</center><br>
<p>
<p>
It turns out that this last result works the other way; a vector field F , defined over an entire box,
which is divergence-free, is the curl of <i>some</i> other vector field G.

 <b>The Divergence Theorem</b></DD></DL>
If W is a region in 3-space, it boundary is a surface S. (S might actually consist of 
several pieces; this won't really effect our discussion.) We can choose normal vectors for
each piece of S by insisting that [n\vec] alway points <i>out</i> of W. Then we have,
for any vector field F <i>which is defined everywhere in W</i>:
<p>
<p>
<b>The Divergence Theorem:</b>  <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>S</sub> [F\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[A\vec] = 
 <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>W</sub> (div F) dV 
<p>
<p>
In other words, we can compute flux integrals over a surface S that forms the boundary
of a region W, by computing the integral of a <i>different</i> function over W. This
is especially useful when the vector field is divergence-free; for example if the region W
has two surfaces for boundary and F is divergence-free, then the flux integral of F over
one surface, with normals pointing out of W, is <i>equal</i> to the flux integral of F over
the <i>other</i> surface, with normals pointing <i>into</i> W. Even if F is not divergence-free,
we can compute the flux integral of one as the flux integral of the other <i>plus</i> the 
triple integral of the divergence over W.

 <b>The curl of a vector field</b></DD></DL>
We have already met the curl of a vector field [F\vec] = (F<sub>1</sub>,F<sub>2</sub>,F<sub>3</sub> in 3-space; 
in terms of coordinates:
<p>
<p>

<center>curl([F\vec]) = ((F<sub>3</sub>)<sub>y</sub>-(F<sub>2</sub>)<sub>z</sub> , -((F<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub>-(F<sub>1</sub>)<sub>z</sub>) , (F<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x</sub>-(F<sub>1</sub>)<sub>y</sub>) </center><br>
<p>
<p>
Its physical interpretation is as the direction where the <i>circulation density</i> of 
the vector field [F\vec],
at the point P, is the <i>largest</i>. The
circulation density measures the extent to which objects caught up in a (velocity)
vector field `want' to rotate with their axis pointing in the direction of a (unit) 
vector [n\vec], and is computed
as the limit, as the side lengths go to 0, of the line integral of [F\vec] around
the boundary of a little square around P and <i>perpendicular</i> to [n\vec], divided
by the area of the square. In terms of the curl, it can be computed as
<p>
<p>

<center>circ <sub>[n\vec]</sub>([F\vec]) = curl([F\vec])<font face="symbol">·</font
>[n\vec]</center><br>
<p>
<p>
We have already used the curl to detect conservative vector fields; this stems from the
formula
<p>

<center>curl(<font face="symbol">Ñ</font
>[F\vec]) = (0,0,0)</center><br>
<p>
A vector field [F\vec] is <i>curl-free</i> if curl[F\vec] = (0,0,0) . This means that in any 
<i>box</i> in which [F\vec] is defined, [F\vec] is a gradient vector field (although it
is possible that [F\vec] cannot be expressed as the gradient of a function everywhere that
[F\vec] is defined <i>at the same time</i>; the standard example of this is the vector field
<p>

<center>[F\vec] =  ([(-y)/(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)],[x/(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)],0)</center><br>
<p>
[F\vec] is curl-free, but it is not a gradient vector field, since (as you can check)
the line integral of [F\vec] around the circle of radius one in the x-y plane with center
(0,0,0) is 2<font face="symbol">p</font
>. Green's Theorem does not work, because [F\vec] (and so its curl) is not defined
on the entire disk with boundary the circle.)

 <b>Stokes' Theorem</b></DD></DL>
If S is a surface in 3-space, with a normal orientation [n\vec], the boundary of 
S is a colection of paramatrized curves (there can easily be more than one, e.g, if
S is a cylinder). We can orient each curve using a <i>right-hand rule</i>; if we
stand on the curve and walk along it the chosen orientation with our heads pointing
in the direction of [N\vec], then the surface S dshould always be on our left.
Then Stokes' Theorem says that, for any vector field [F\vec] defined everywhere on S:
<p>

<center> <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>C</sub> [F\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[r\vec] = <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>S</sub> (curl[F\vec])<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[A\vec]</center><br>
<p>
This allows us to compute line integrals as flux integrals, and, with a little work, 
flux integrals as line integrals. 
<p>
For example, it says that the line integral of a curl-free vector field [F\vec] around 
a closed  curve is 
always 0, <i>so long as</i> the curve is the boundary of a surface contained entirely
in the domain of [F\vec]. 
<p>
<p>
We say that a vector field [F\vec] is a <i>curl field</i> if [F\vec] = curl([G\vec])
for some vector field [G\vec] . [G\vec] is called a <i>vector potential</i> of [F\vec] .
Then Stokes' Theorem says that, for any surface S in the domain of [F\vec] with 
boundary C,
<p>

<center> <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>S</sub> [F\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[A\vec] = <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>S</sub> curl
[G\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[A\vec] = <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>C</sub> [G\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[r\vec]</center><br>
<p>
So, for example, for a curl field [F\vec] and <i>two</i> surfaces S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>
with the <i>same</i> boundary C, we have
<p>

<center><font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>S<sub>1</sub></sub>[F\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[A\vec] = <font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>S<sub>2</sub></sub>[F\vec]<font face="symbol">·</font
>d[A\vec]</center><br>
<p>
So the flux integral of a curl field <i>really</i> depends just on the boundary of the surface, 
not on the surface.
<p>
<p>
We can test for whether or not [F\vec] is a curl field, using the divergence, 
since div(curl([G\vec])) = 0, so a curl field must be divergence-free. (The opposite, as we have seen,
 is <i>almost</i> true; it is true, for example, if the vector field is defined in a big box.)
<p>
<p>

The whole idea behind these three theorems (Green's, Divergence, and Stokes')
is that the integral of one kind of function over one kind of region can be computed
instead as the integral of <i>another</i> kind of function over the <i>boundary</i> of
the region. 
<p>
<p>

Green's: Integral of the vector field [F\vec] over a closed curve in the 
plane equals integral of its curl of [F\vec] over the region in the plane
that the curve bounds.
<p>
Divergence: The flux integral of a vector field [F\vec] through the boundary of a 
region in 3-space equals the integral of the divergence of [F\vec] over the
region in 3-space.
<p>
Stokes':  The line integral of the vector field [F\vec] over a closed curve C in 3-space
equals the flux integral of the curl of [F\vec] over any surface S that has C as its
boundary.
<p>
<p>
Note that Green's Theorem is really just a special case of Stokes' (where the 
curve C lies in the plane, and the third coordinate of [F\vec] just happens to 
be 0). All of these, like the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, are really
a kind of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, where we are computing a kind of integral
by instead computing something else across the boundary of the region we are
interested in. We could keep doing this, finding a relation between integrals over
regions in 4-space (or higher!) in terms of integrals over thier `boundary', but we 
won't do that....
