 <b>The types of differential equations</b></DD></DL>
A differential equation is an equation involoving an (unknown) function y and
some of its derivatives. The basic goal is to <i>solve</i> the equation, i.e., to 
determine which function or functions satisfy the equation. Differential equations
come in several types, and our techniques for solving them will differ 
depending on the type.
<p>
<p>
<i>Ordinary vs. partial:</i> If y is a function of only one variable t, then our
differential equation&nbsp;will involve only derivatives w.r.t. t, and we will call the equation an
it ordinary differential equation. If y is a function of more than one variable, then our differential equation&nbsp;
will involve partial derivatives, and we will call it a <i>partial differential equation</i>. We
will deal almost exclusively with ordinary differential equations&nbsp;in this class.
<p>
<p>
<i>Systems:</i> Sometimes the rates of change of several functions are 
inter-related, as with the populations of a predator y(t) and its prey x(t),
where x<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = ax-<font face="symbol">a</font
>xy and y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = <font face="symbol">g</font
>xy - cy . We call 
this a <i>system</i> of differential equations, and its solution would involve finding both 
x(t) and y(t).
<p>
<p>
<i>Order:</i> Techniques for solving differential equations&nbsp;differ depending upon how many
derivatives of our unknown function are involved. The <i>order</i> of a 
differential equation&nbsp;is the order of the highest derivative appearing in the equation. 
The Implicit Function Theorem tells us that we can rewrite our equation so that
it equates the highest order derivative with an expression involving lower
order terms:
<p>

<center>y<sup>(n)</sup> = F(t,y,y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup>,<font face="symbol">¼</font
>,y<sup>(n-1)</sup></center><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>Linear vs. non-linear:</i> A differential equation&nbsp;is <i>linear</i> if it can be written as
<p>

<center>a<sub>0</sub>(t)y<sup>(n)</sup>+<font face="symbol">¼</font
>+a<sub>n-1</sub>(t)y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup>+a<sub>n</sub>(t)y = g(t)</center><br>
<p>
(i.e., the function F is linear in the variables y,y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup>,<font face="symbol">¼</font
>,y<sup>(n-1)</sup>,
although it <b>need not</b> be linear in t). A differential equation&nbsp;is non-linear if it isn't
linear! E.g., 
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = y<sup>2</sup></center><br> 
<p>
is non-linear, while 
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = (sint)y/(1+t<sup>2</sup>) - cos(cost)</center><br>
<p>
is linear.
<p>
<p>
In many cases, especially for first order differential equations, we can `see' what a solution
should look like without actually finding the solution. For first order
equations, y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = f(t,y), a solution y(t) will satisfy 
y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup>(t) = f(t,y(t)), and so we can think of f(t,y) as giving the <i>slope</i>
of the tangent line to the graph of y(t) at the point (t,y(t)). But since the function f
is already known, we can draw small line segments at `every' point of the t-y plane
with slope f(t,y) at the point (t,y); this is called the
<i>direction field</i> for our differential equation. A solution to our differential equation&nbsp;is
simply a function whose graph is tangent to each of these line segments at every
point along the graph. Thinking of the direction field as a velocity vector field
(always pointing to the right), our solution is then the path of a particle being
push along by the velocity vector field. From this point of view it is not 
hard to believe that <i>every</i> (first order ordinary) differential equation&nbsp;has a solution, in 
fact many solutions; you just drop a particle in and watch where it goes. <i>Where</i>
you drop it is important (it changes where it goes), which gives rise to the
notion of an <i>initial value problem</i>; we seek to find the specific solution
with the additional <i>initial value</i> y(t<sub>0</sub>) = y<sub>0</sub>.
<p>

<b>Chapter 2:</b> First order differential equations
<p>
<p>

<DL compact><DT>&#167; 1:
</DT><DD>
 <b>Linear equations</b></DD></DL>
The most straightforward sort of differential equation&nbsp;to solve is the <i>first order
linear ordinary differential equation</i> 
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = a(t)y+b(t)</center><br>
<p>
We will typically (following tradition) write such equations as
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> + p(t)y = g(t)</center><br>
<p>
For example, near the earth and in the presence of air resistance, the
velocity v of a falling object obeys the differential equation&nbsp;v<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = g -kv, 
where g and k are (positive) constants.
<p>
There is a general technique for solving such equations, by trying to think of the
left-hand side of the equation as the derivative of a single function. In form it
look like the derivative of a product, and by introducing an <i>integrating factor</i> <font face="symbol">m</font
>(t),
we can actually arrange this. Writing
<p>

<center>(<font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)y)<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = <font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)(y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup>+p(t)y)) = <font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)g(t)</center><br>
<p>
we find that (where exp(blah) means e raised to the power `blah')
<p>

<center><font face="symbol">m</font
>(t) = exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t) dt)</center><br>
<p>
and so
<p>

<center><font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)y = <font face="symbol">ò</font
><font face="symbol">m</font
>(t)g(t) dt = <font face="symbol">ò</font
>(exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t) dt)) g(t) dt +c</center><br>
<p>
which we can then solve for y.
<p>
<p>
For example, the differential equation&nbsp;ty<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> -y = t<sup>2</sup>+1 , after being rewritten in 
`standard form as y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> -(1/t)y = t+(1/t), has integrating factor
<p>

<center><font face="symbol">m</font
>(t) = exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>-1/t dt) = exp(-lnt) = 1/t</center><br>
<p>
so we have 
<p>

<center>(1/t)y = <font face="symbol">ò</font
>1+1/t<sup>2</sup> dt = t-(1/t)+c</center><br>
<p>
and so our solutions are y = t<sup>2</sup>-1+ct, where c is a constant.
<p>
<p>
But what is c ? Or solution is actually a <i>family</i> of solutions; a 
particular solution (i.e., a particular value for c) can be found from 
an initial value y(t<sub>0</sub>) =y<sub>0</sub>. For example, if we wished to solve
the initial value problem 
<p>

<center>ty<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> -y = t<sup>2</sup>+1 , y(2) = 5</center><br>
<p>
we can plug t = 2 and y = 5 into our general solution to obtain c = 1 .
<p>
<p>

<DL compact><DT>&#167; 2:
</DT><DD>
 <b>Existence and uniqueness</b></DD></DL>
Our solution above can be expressed more concisely by saying that the solution(s)
to 
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> + p(t)y = g(t)</center><br>
<p>
are
<p>

<center>y = exp(-<font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t) dt)(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>exp(-<font face="symbol">ò</font
>p(t) dt)g(t) dt + c)</center><br>
<p>
where c is determined from an initial value. We can check that this actually
<i>is</i> a solution by pluging it into our differential equation&nbsp;and seeing that it does in fact solve it.
<p>
We can in fact write down the solution to the added initial value problem
y(t<sub>0</sub>) = y<sub>0</sub> as
<p>

<center>y = exp(-<font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>t<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>t</sup> p(x) 
dx)(<font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>t<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>t</sup> exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
><sub>t<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>u</sup> p(v) dv) g(u) du + y<sub>0</sub>)</center><br>
<p>
although in practice this is more trouble than it is worth.
<p>
<p>
But this formula does tell us one important thing; for every first order
linear ordinary differential equation, every initial value problem has a solution (we just wrote
it down), and that solution is <i>unique</i> (because it has to <i>be</i> the
one we wrote down). This is the basic existence and uniqueness theorem.
<p>
It actually says more (or less): the solution exists and is unique over any interval
where the integrals we've written down make sense, which amount to any interval
where <i>both</i> p(t) and g(t) are continuous. In other words, a solution to
a linear differential equation can blow up or fail to be continuous only at the 
points of discontinuity of p or g .
<p>
<p>

<DL compact><DT>&#167; 3:
</DT><DD>
 <b>Separable equations</b></DD></DL>
There is another class of first order equations for which we can readily
find solutions by integration; there are the <i>separable</i> equations. A
differential equation&nbsp;is separable if it can be written as
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = A(t)B(y)</center><br>
<p>
This allows us to `separate the variables' and integrate with respect to dy and dt
to get a solution:
<p>

<center> [1/B(y)]dy = A(t) dt ; integrate both sides</center><br>
<p>
In the end, our solution looks like F(y) = G(t) + c, so it defines y
<i>implicitly</i> as a function of t , rather than explicitly. In some cases
we can invert F to get an explicit solution, but often we cannot.
<p>
<p>
For example, the separable equation y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = ty<sup>2</sup> , y(1) = 2 has solution
<p>

<center> <font face="symbol">ò</font
>[dy/(y<sup>2</sup>)] = <font face="symbol">ò</font
>t dt + c</center><br>
<p>
so solving the integrals we get (-1/y) = (t<sup>2</sup>/2)+c, or y = -2/(t<sup>2</sup>+2c) ; 
setting y = 2 when t = 1 gives c = -1 .
<p>
<p>

<DL compact><DT>&#167; 4:
</DT><DD>
 <b>Linear versus non-linear equations</b></DD></DL>
There is a similar, but more restrictive, version of existence and uniqueness
for non-linear first order differential equations:
<p>
<p>
If y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = f(t,y) is a differential equation with both f and 
[(<font face="symbol">¶</font
>f)/(<font face="symbol">¶</font
>y)] continuous for a<font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
>t<font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
>b and <font face="symbol">a</font
><font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
> y <font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
> <font face="symbol">b</font
>,
and t<sub>0</sub> <font face="symbol">Î</font
> (a,b) and y<sub>0</sub> <font face="symbol">Î</font
> (<font face="symbol">a</font
>,<font face="symbol">b</font
>), then <i>for some</i> h<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>0,
the initial value problem 
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = f(t,y) , y(t<sub>0</sub>) = y<sub>0</sub></center><br>
<p>
has a unique solution for t <font face="symbol">Î</font
> (t<sub>0</sub>-h,t<sub>0</sub>+h) .
<p>
<p>
With non-linear equations, however, the size of the interval where we can 
guarantee existence (and uniqueness) can be very small, and often depends
on the choice of initial value! For example,  for the equation
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = y<sup>2</sup></center><br>
<p>
the righthand side is continuous everywhere (as is the partial derivative),
but the interval we can choose for the solutions y = -1/(t+c) depends on c, 
which will depend on the initial condition! And it can <i>never</i> be chosen 
to be the entire real line.
<p>
<p>
Failure to satisfy the hypotheses of the result can easily kill both 
existence and uniqueness. For example, the equation
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = y<sup>1/3</sup></center><br>
<p>
has many solutions with the initial condition y(0) = 0, such as y = 0 and 
y = (2t/3)<sup>3/2</sup> .

 <b>Modeling with linear equations</b></DD></DL>
<i>Radioactive decay:</i> Our best model of the spontaneous decay of a 
radioactive substance assumes that every atom is as likely to decay at any given time
as every other, so the rate of decay is proportional to the amount
present. In other words, if A(t) = the amount present at time t,
then 
<p>

<center>A<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = kAfor some (negative) constant k</center><br>
<p>
Soving this, we find that A(t) = Ce<sup>kt</sup> for some constant
C. Using the initial value A(0) = A<sub>0</sub>, we find that 
A(t) = A<sub>0</sub>e<sup>kt</sup>. 
<p>
Usually, we are not <i>given</i> k, but are given either the 
half-life (the time t<sub>1/2</sub> with A(t<sub>1/2</sub>) = (1/2)A(0)), or,
more generally, another data point A(t<sub>1</sub>) = A<sub>1</sub> . Plugging these
into the equation above, we can solve for k .
<p>
<p>
<i>Mixing problems:</i> The basic setup has a solution of a known
concentration mixing at a known rate with a solution in a vat,
while the mixed solution is poured off at a known rate. The 
problem is to find the function which gives concentration in the vat
at time t. It turns out that it is much easier to find a differential equation\
which describes the amount of solute (e.g., salt) in the
solution (e.g., water), rather than the concentration.
<p>
If the concentration pouring in is A, at a rate of N, while the 
solution is pouring out at rate M with concentration A(t)=
x(t)/V(t), then if the initial volume is V<sub>0</sub>, we can 
compute V(t) = V<sub>0</sub>+(N-M)t . The change in the amount x(t) of
solute can be computed as (rate falling in)-(rate falling out),
which is
<p>

<center>x<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = AN - A(t)M = 
 AN-[x/(V<sub>0</sub>+(N-M)t)]M</center><br>
<p>
This is a linear equation, and so we can solve it using our 
techniques above. The integrating factor 
<p>

<center> exp(<font face="symbol">ò</font
>[M/(V<sub>0</sub>+(N-M)t)]dt)</center><br>
<p>
is a power of the denomenator when N-M <font face="symbol">¹</font
> 0, and is an 
exponential when N = M .
<p>
<p>
<i>Newton's Law of Cooling:</i> This states that the rate of
change of the temperature
T(t) of an object is proportional to the difference between
is temperature and the ambient temperature of the air around it.
The constant of proportionality depends upon the particular
object (and the medium, e.g., air or water) it is in. In other
words,
<p>

<center>T<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = k(A-T)</center><br>
<p>
Since a cold object will warm up, and a warm object will cool
down, this means that the constant k should be positive. Writing
the equation as
<p>

<center>T<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> +kT = kA</center><br>
<p>
which has solutions
<p>

<center>T(t) = A+(T(0)-A)e<sup>-kt</sup></center><br>
<p>
Typically, k is not given, but can be determined by
knowing the temperature at some other time t<sub>0</sub>, by 
plugging into the equation above and solving for k.
<p>
<p>

<DL compact><DT>&#167; 6:
</DT><DD>
 <b>Population models and autonomous equations</b></DD></DL>
A differential equation is called <i>autonomous</i> if
the function f(t,y) is realy a function f(y) only of the
variable y. Such equations are separable, and so can be
solved using the techniques outlined above. But we can
learn alot about the solutions to such an equation simply 
by understanding the graph of f(y) .
<p>
One feature of the solutions is that we can translate in
time and get another solution; if y(t) is a 
solution to y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = f(y), then so is z(t) = y(t+c)
for any constant c, as can be verified by plugging z into
the differential equation. This can also be verified geometrically, using
the direction field approach. For an autonomous equation, 
the slope of the direction field is always the same along
horizontal lines (since it depends on y, not t), and so if
we pick up a solution curve, tangent to the direction field,
and translate it in the horizontal direction, it will <i>still</i>
be everywhere tangent to the direction field, and so is also a 
solution.
<p>
An example of such equations come from population models. The
idea is that if y is the population at time t, then
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = (birth rate) - (death rate)</center><br>
<p>
Typically, the birth rate is proportional to the population,
i.e. is ry, while the death rate is proportional to the 
square of the population (this typically represents contact
between individuals,arising from competition for food, overcrowding,
etc.), i.e., is ky<sup>2</sup> . In other words,
<p>

<center>y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = ry-ky<sup>2</sup></center><br>
<p>
The key to understanding solutions to such equations
y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = f(y) is to find <i>equilibrium solutions</i>, that
is, solutions y = constant =c . Such solutions have derivative
0, and so for such solutions we must have f(c) = 0. The basic
idea is that these equilibrium solutions tell us a great deal about 
the behavior of <i>every</i> solution to the differential equation.
<p>
<p>
If the function f(y) is continuous, then between the zeroes
of f (i.e., the equilibrium
solutions of the differential equation) f has all the same sign, and so for the 
solutions, y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> has the same sign, so y(t) is either 
always 
increasing or always decreasing. It cannot <i>cross</i>
the equilibrium solutions, since this would violate
the uniqueness of solutions to our differential equation. (Here we assume
that the derivative of f is also continuous.) If a
solution curve becomes asymptotic to a horizontal line, that 
line must <i>be</i> an equilibrium solution, because
the tangent lines along our solution must be becoming 
horizontal, i.e., f(y(t)) = f(y) is approaching 0 = f(limit
of y(t)). 
<p>
Therefore, the structure of the solutions is very simple; between
consecutive equilibrium solutions, the solutions increase or
decrease monotonically from one equilibrium to the other.
This allows us to classify equilibrium solutions as one of
three kinds: <i>stable equilibria</i>, where nearby
solutions all converge <i>back</i> to the equilibrium, 
<i>unstable equilibria</i>, where nearby
solutions all diverge away from the equilibrium, and
<i>semistable equilibria</i>, where on one side the
solutions converge back, and on the other they diverge away.
<p>
The easiest way to assemble this data is to plot the roots of f
on a number line, and then determine the sign of f in the intervals
in between. Where it is positive, solutions move to the right 
(i.e., up), while where it is negative they move left. Marking
these as arrows, a stable equilibrium has arrows on both sides
pointing towards it, and an unstable equilibrium has both
arrows pointing away.

<DL compact><DT>&#167; 1:
</DT><DD>
 <b>The tangent line method</b></DD></DL>
Most first order equations cannot be solved by the methods
we have presented here. For such equations, the best we can often
do is to <i>approximate</i> the solutions, using numerical techniques.
The first of these techniques that were studied is the it 
tangent line method, also known as <i>Euler's method</i>. The idea is
that our differential equation y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup> = f(t,y) tells us
the slope of the tangent line at every point of our solution, 
and the tangent line can be used to approximate the graph
of a function, at least close to the point of tangency. In other
words, for a solution to our differential equation,
<p>

<center>
y(t)  <font face="symbol">»</font
> y(t<sub>0</sub>)+y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup>(t<sub>0</sub>)(t-t<sub>0</sub>) = y<sub>0</sub>+f(t<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>)(t-t<sub>0</sub>)</center><br>
<p>
for t-t<sub>0</sub> small. If we wish to approximate y(t) for a value of t
far away from our initial value t<sub>0</sub>, we use
the above idea in several steps. 
We cut up the interval into n pieces of length h (called the
<i>stepsize</i>), and then 
set
<p>

<center>y<sub>1</sub> = y<sub>0</sub>+f(t<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>)h , t<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>0</sub>+h</center><br>
<p>

<center>y<sub>2</sub> = y<sub>1</sub>+f(t<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)h , t<sub>2</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>+h</center><br>
<p>

<center>y<sub>3</sub> = y<sub>2</sub>+f(t<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)h , t<sub>3</sub> = t<sub>2</sub>+h</center><br>
<p>
and continue until we reach y<sub>n</sub>, which will be our approximation
to y(t) = y(t<sub>n</sub>) . Each step can be thought of as a mid-course
correction, using information about the direction field at each stage
to determine which way the solution is tending.
<p>
Calculus teaches us that at each stage the error introduced
is approximately proportional to the square of h. So with a
stepsize half as large, we will require twice as many steps, but
each introduces an error only about one-fourth as large, so overall
we get an error only half as large. This leads us to conclude
that as the stepsize goes to 0, the error between our approximate solution
y<sub>n</sub> and y(t<sub>n</sub>) goes to 0. 
<p>
<p>
A slightly different technique is called <i>backwards Euler</i>, 
where we use the approximation 
<p>

<center>y(t<sub>i</sub>)  <font face="symbol">»</font
> y<sub>i+1</sub> + y<sup><font face="symbol">¢</font
></sup>(t<sub>i+1</sub>)(t<sub>i</sub>-t<sub>i+1</sub>) = 
y<sub>i+1</sub> + f(t<sub>i+1</sub>,y<sub>i+1</sub>)(-h)</center><br>
<p>
and so we use the step
<p>

<center>y<sub>i</sub> = y<sub>i+1</sub> - f(t<sub>i+1</sub>,y<sub>i+1</sub>)h</center><br>
<p>
This defines y<sub>i+1</sub> implicitly in terms of y<sub>i</sub> ; if we can 
solve this equation (essentially, by inverting the function on
the right-hand side), we can then use this to determine a
(different) y<sub>n</sub> from the initial value y<sub>0</sub> . The
analysis of how well this method does to approximate the 
true value of y(t) is essentially the same as for (forward)
Euler.
