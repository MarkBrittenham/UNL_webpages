\hskip-39pt {\bf (*) 30:} (Lee, p.172, Problem 7-8) If $F:M\ra N$ is a submersion
and $X$ is a smooth vector field on $N$, show that there is a smooth 
vector field $Y$ on $M$ that is $F$-related to $X$.

\msk

\nidt {\bf 31:} Show that the set $\{(x,|x|) : x\in \bbr\}$ is not the image of 
any immersion of $\bbr$ into $\bbr^2$ . (Hint: nothing fancy, just beat it over
the head with calculus?)

\msk

\hskip-39pt {\bf (*) 32:} (a) If $U\subseteq \bbr^n$ is open and $F:U\ra \bbr^m$ is smooth, 
show that the graph of $F$, $\Gamma(F)=\{(x,F(x))\in \bbr^{n+m} : x\in U\}$ is an
embedded submanifold of $\bbr^{n+m}$.

\msk

(b) Show, conversely, that every embedded submanifold of $\bbr^N$ is locally of this
form. (You will need to use the implicit function theorem?)

\msk

\nidt {\bf 33:} (a) Show that an immersion from one $n$-manifold to another is an open map.

\msk

(b) Show that if $M$ and $N$ are $n$-manifolds, $M$ is compact, $N$ is connected, and
$F:M\ra N$ is an immersion, then $F$ is onto.

\msk

\nidt {\bf 34:} If $S\subseteq M$ is a closed, embedded submanifold, $U\supseteq S$
is an open neighborhood of $S$, and 
$f:S\ra \bbr$ is a smooth function, show that there is a smooth function
$F:M\ra \bbr$ with $F|_S=f$ and supp$(F)\subseteq U$.
