<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 4500 class
for Spring, 1998. 

There are of course alot of <a href="http://www.achilles.net/~mtalbot/TopoBio.html">textbooks</a>
on topology out there......<p>

And there is an effort underway to build a
web-based <a href="http://www.unipissing.ca/topology/course/index.htm">Topology Course</a>,
at what appears to be an undergraduate level. It's probably worth checking out, just to
see what they're up to?<p>

There is a fairly wide ranging discussion of 
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/54-XX.html">General Topology</a>
(i.e., point-set topology), which is part of a larger group of pages on the various
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/beginners.html#GEO">
divisions of mathematics</a>.<p>

More generally, there is the rather entertaining <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/">
Interactive Mathematics Miscellany</a> page. My favorite little tidbit so far has been
"[By the extreme value theorem,] for any object there is a distance at which it 
looks its best." (It took me a little while to figure out why that was actually true.)<p>

<!-- Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.htm">homework assignments</a>, -->
<!-- dates for <a href="exam.htm">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams, -->
<!-- an html-ized copy of the <a href="summ.htm">course summary</a>, and anything else that -->
<!-- might come up. -->
