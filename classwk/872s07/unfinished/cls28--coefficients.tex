{\bf Homology with coefficients:} The chain complexes that we have dealt with so far have
had elements which are $\bbz$-linear combinations of basis elements (which are
themselves singular simplices or equivalence classes of them); that is, the chain
groups have been free abelian groups. Formally, though, there is no reason to restrict
ourselves to $\bbz$ coefficients; all that is required is to add
coefficients and take the negative of a chain (i.e., the negatives of its
coefficients). Any abelian group $G$ can be used as coefficient group; the
(singular or simplicial) chain complex $C_*(X;G)$ consists of the groups
$C_n(X;G)=\{\sum g_i\sigma_i : \sigma_i:\Delta^i\ra X\}$ of formal $G$-linear
combinations of (singular or actual) $i$-simplices in $X$. Defining boundary maps
as before, we write $\del_i g\sigma = \sum (-1)^jg \sigma|_{\text{faces}}$;
$(-1)^j$ isn't thought of as an integer, but as altering the coefficient
assigned to a face, between $g$ and $-g$. Our formulas then go through unchanged,
to show that $\del^2=0$, so $C_*(X;G)$ is a chain complex. Its homology groups 
are called the (simplicial or singular) {\it homology groups of $X$ with coefficients in $G$},
denoted $H_*(X;G)$. ``Ordinary'' homology, in this context, would be denoted $H_*(X;\bbz)$

\ssk

The machinery we have built up to work with ordinary homology carries over to homology
with coefficients; none of our proofs really used the fact that our coefficient group was $\bbz$.
With one exception; our computations of simplicial homology groups, via Smith normal form,
specifically used row and column operations over $\bbz$. But this points out the fact that
it is really linear algebra that is required to carry out computations; if we choose a coefficient
group which is (the additive group of) a \u{field} $F$, then we can treat our chain groups
$C_n(X;F)$ as vector spaces over $F$, and the boundary maps are linear
transformations, where we know that $B_i=\text{im}\ \del_{i+1}$ is a subvector space of 
$Z_i=\ker\del_i$, and $H_i(X;F)=Z_i/B_i$ is a vector space over $F$, i.e., 
$H_i(X;F)\cong F^{n_i}$ for some $n_i$ (possibly infinite). 

\vfill
\eject

[We use the field structure to \u{prove} this, but never need the 
multiplicative structure to present it. There \u{is} something to prove
here, though: if $z$ is a cycle, so is $az$ for any $a\in F$ (formally, this is multiplying 
coeffiecients), and the same is true for boundaries. But the point is that we are imposing
the vector space structure from the ``outside'' (the computations don't care), and noting
that from this point of view $\del(az)=a\del z$, i.e., that $\del$ is a linear transformation.
This \u{helps} us do computations, but isn't \u{required} to do them.] 

\ssk

We can also introduce
reduced homology with coefficients, by augmenting a chain complex with an evaluation map 
$c_0(X;G)\ra G\ra 0$, which takes the sum of the coefficients of a $0$-chain. 
We can also extend things to cellular homology. Working through
the computations again, we find, for a CW-complex $X$, that 

\ssk

\ctln{$H_n(X^{(n)},X^{(n-1)};G)\cong 
\wtih_n(\vee S^n;G)\cong \oplus G$,}

\ssk

one summand for each $n$-cell, and we can construct cellular 
homology with coefficients and show that $H_n^{CW}(X;G)\cong H_n(X;G)$ in the exact same way 
(the same of course, is true of simplicial homology with coefficients). The only point to really
make is that the computation of the cellular boundary maps 

\ssk

\ctln{$H_n(X^{(n)},X^{(n-1)};G)\ra H_{n-1}(X^{(n-1)},X^{(n-2)};G)$}

\ssk

again amounts to computing
the maps 

\ssk

\ctln{$f_*:G = H_{n-1}(S^{n-1};G)\ra H_{n-1}(S^{n-1};G)=G$}

\ssk

induced by the attaching map 

\ssk

\ctln{$f:S^{n-1}\ra X^{(n-1)}\ra X^{(n-1)}/X^{(n-2)}\cong \vee S^{n-1}\ra S^{n-1}$}

\ssk

of an $n$-cell; 
if this map has degree $m$, then $f_*:G\ra G$ is multiplication by $m$. 

\vfill
\eject

So, for
example, we can compute the homology groups 
$H_k(\bbr P^n;\bbz_2)$ via cellular homology by noting that using the standard CW-structure
with one cell in each dimension, where before the cellular boundary maps $\bbz\ra\bbz$ were either
$0$ or multiplication by $2$, now the maps $\bbz_2\ra \bbz_2$ are all $0$ (since in $\bbz_2$ 
multiplication by $2$ \u{is} $0$). So in every computation $\ker = \bbz_2$ and $\text{im}\ = 0$,
so $H_k(\bbr P^n;\bbz_2)\cong \bbz_2$ for all $0\leq k\leq n$, and is $0$ otherwise.

\msk

Coefficients do introduce one additional feature; a homomorphism of groups
$\varphi:G\ra H$ induces chain maps on complexes $C_n(X;G)\ra C_n(X;H)$, via
$\sum g_i\sigma_i\mapsto \sum \varphi(g_i)\sigma_i$. Even more, a short exact
sequence of coefficient groups $0\ra K\ra G\ra H\ra 0$ induces SESs of chain
complexes $0\ra C_*(X;K)\ra C_*(X;G)\ra C_*(X;H)\ra 0$, giving long exact homology
sequences interweaving the homology groups of $X$ with coefficients in $G,H$, and $K$.
For example, the SES 

\ssk

\ctln{$0\ra \bbz \buildrel{\times m}\over\ra \bbz\ra \bbz_m\ra 0$}

\ssk

gives the LEHS

\ssk

\ctln{$\cdots\ra H_n(X)\buildrel{(\times m)_*}\over \ra H_n(X)\ra H_n(X;\bbz_m)\ra H_{n-1}(X)\buildrel{(\times m)_*}\over \ra H_{n-1}(X)\ra\cdots$.}

\msk

Using the meta-fact that an exact sequence 

\ssk

\ctln{$A\buildrel{\alpha}\over\ra B\buildrel{\beta}\over\ra C\buildrel{\gamma}\over\ra D\buildrel{\delta}\over\ra E$}

\ssk

can be replaced with 

\ctln{$0\ra B/\text{im}\ \alpha\buildrel{\overline{\beta}}\over\ra C\buildrel{\gamma}\over\ra\ker\delta\ra 0$}

\ssk

(since $\text{im}\ \alpha = \ker\beta$ and $\text{im}\ \gamma = \ker\delta$), we get

\ssk

\ctln{$0\ra H_n(X)/\{m[z]: [z]\in H_n(X)\}\ra H_n(X;\bbz_m)\ra \{[z]\in H_{n-1}(X) : m[z]=0\}\ra 0$}

\ssk

is exact. If $m=p=$ prime, then knowing the homology of $X$ allows us to compute $H_n(X;\bbz_p)$, since we can compute the two
groups on the ends (hence their dimensions over $\bbz_p$), which allows us to compute the dimension of $H_n(X;\bbz_p)$,
hence compute $H_n(X;\bbz_p)$. This last part follows since the alternating sum of the dimensions over $\bbz_p$ of the terms in these
exact sequences is $0$, for the exact same reason this is true about ranks over $\bbz$. Such a number is invariant under taking 
homology; the proof for rank over $\bbz$ goes through unchanged.
