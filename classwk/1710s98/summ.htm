<b>Class:</b> MTWRF 11:00 - 11:50  Language (LANG) 209
<p>
Math 1710 is a 4 credit-hour course, and so is expected to meet for 4 hours
each week. Our room is, however, available for all 5 days. It will be our 
basic policy that class will only meet Monday thru Thursday; however, the
instructor reserves the right, under sufficiently unusual circumstances, to
hold some classes on Friday. For example, midterm examinations might be held
on Fridays.<p>

<b>Prerequisite:</b> Math 1650 (or equivalent)

<b>Office Hours:</b> (tentatively) Tu 2:00 - 3:00, We 9:30-10:30, We 2:00 - 3:00, 
and Th 1:00 - 2:00, and whenever you can find me in my office and I'm not 
horrendously busy. You are also quite welcome to make an appointment
for any other time; this is easiest to arrange just before or 
after class.

<b>Text:</b> <i>Calculus</i>, by Thomas and Finney (9th edition).
<p>
This course, as the name is intended to imply, is the first of several where you
learn the basics of what we call calculus. We will basically cover the first 
third of the text. In particular, we will cover the
following sections of the book (although not necessarily in this order):
<p>

<dl>
<dd>Ch. 1, Limits and Continuity: sections 1.1 thru 1.6

<dd>Ch. 2, Derivatives: sections 2.1 thru 2.7

<dd>Ch. 3, Applications of Derivatives: sections 3.1 thru 3.8

<dd>Ch. 4, Integration: sections 4.1 thru 4.9

<dd>Ch. 5, Applications of Integration: sections 5.1 thru 5.10


</dl>
<p>

<b>Homework</b> will be assigned from each section, as we finish it. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics, we learn best by doing (again and again and ...). Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you must write up solutions on your own - after 
all, you get to bring only one brain to exams (and it can't be someone 
else's). For the same reason, I also recommend that you try working 
each problem on your own, first. Assignments will be due two class periods following 
the period they were assigned. Some fraction of the problems will be graded; but I highly
recommend that you not try to second-guess the instructor, and work them all.
Homeworks handed in late will be recorded as turned in but 
not graded. Homework will count 15% toward your grade.

<p>

<b>Midterm exams</b> will be given three times during the 
semester, approximately every four weeks - the specific dates will 
be announced in class well in advance (likely candidates: end of Feb., 
end of March, end of
April). Each exam will count 20% toward your grade. You can take a 
make-up exam only if there are compelling reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you to miss an exam. Make-up 
exams tend to be harder than the originals (because make-up exams 
are harder to write!). 

<p>

Finally, there will be a regularly scheduled <b>final exam</b> on 
Monday, May 11, from 10:30am to 12:30pm. 
It will cover the entire course, with a slight emphasis 
on material covered after the last midterm exam. It will count the 
remaining 25% toward your grade.

<p>
<p>
<b>Your course grade</b> will be calculated numerically using the above scales,
and will be converted to a letter grade based partly on the overall average of the
class. However, a score of 90% or better will guarantee an <b>A</b>, 80%
or better a <b>B</b>, 70% or better a <b>C</b>, and 60% or better a <b>D</b>.
<p>
<p>

In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make<i>sure</i> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's<i>your</i> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's alot easier to read 100 pages in a week than it is
in a day. Try to do some mathematics every single day.
<b>Class attendance</b> is probably your best way to insure that you will keep 
up with the material, and make sure that you understand all of the
concepts. I will not be taking attendance; I expect that you will simply 
see the wisdom of attending class, for yourselves.

<p>

<b>Calculators</b> are terrific devices for finding (approximate) numerical
answers. However, the goal of this course is to teach you <i>how</i> to find
the answers, not to actually<i>get</i> the answers. And the numbers we will
typically be tossing around will be simple enough that using a calculator would
just get in the way. Consequently, you are requested not to use them, except
perhaps as a way to verify the correctness of your work. Get used to not using
them, however, because they will be specifically banned from most of our exams.

<p>

<b>Note:</b> In accordance with UNT policies, it is the responsibility of students with 
certified disabilities to provide the instructor with appropriate documentation 
from the Dean of Students Office.
