<b>Text:</b> <i>Precalculus</i>, by Larson and Hostetler (4th edition).
<p>

 This course, as the name is intended to imply, will provide you with (nearly)
all of the tools needed to make a successful attack on the calculus. We will make a good 
stab at covering the entire book during the semester. In particular, we will cover the
following sections of the text (although not necessarily in this order):
<p>

<dl><dd>Ch. 1, Functions and Their Graphs: sections 1.1 thru 1.6

<dd>Ch. 2, Polynomials and Rational Functions: sections 2.1 thru 2.7

<dd>Ch. 3, Exponential and Logarithmic Functions: sections 3.1 thru 3.4

<dd>Ch. 4, Trigonometry: sections 4.1 thru 4.7

<dd>Ch. 5, Analytic Trigonometry: sections 5.1 thru 5.5

<dd>Ch. 6, Additional Topics in Trigonometry: sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.5

<dd>Ch. 9, Sequences and Probability: sections 9.1 thru 9.4

<dd>Ch. 10, Topics in Analytic Geometry: sections 10.1 thru 10.4
</dl>
<p>

Other topics will be included as time allows.
<p>

<b>Homework</b> will be assigned from each section, as we finish it. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics, we learn best by doing (again and again and ...). Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you must write up solutions on your own - after 
all, you get to bring only one brain to exams (and it can't be someone 
else's). For the same reason, I also recommend that you try working 
each problem on your own, first. <a href="hw.htm">Assignments</a> will 
be due in recitation two 
class periods after it is assigned (i.e., Mo assignments are due on Th, We 
assigments are due the following Tu). Some fraction of the problems will be 
graded; these problems will be specially marked on the assignment. But you
are strongly encouraged to work all of the problems; practice really does make
perfect (or a close approximation to it)! Homeworks handed in 
late will be recorded as turned in but not graded. Homework will count 
15% toward your grade.
<p>

<b>Midterm exams</b> will be given four times during the 
semester, approximately every third Tuesday - the specific dates will 
be announced in class well in advance. Each exam will count 15% toward your 
grade. You can take a 
make-up exam only if there are compelling reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you to miss an exam. Make-up 
exams tend to be harder than the originals (because make-up exams 
are harder to write!). 
<p>

Finally, there will be a regularly scheduled <b>final exam</b> on Monday, 
December 14, from 8:00am to 10:00am. (Note that since this class covers two traditional MWF 
time periods, there were two choices for the exam time; the other one was Friday at 8am.).
It will cover the entire course, with a slight emphasis 
on material covered after the last midterm exam. It will count the 
remaining 25% toward your grade.


<p>
<p>

<b>Your course grade</b> will be calculated numerically using the above scales,
and will be converted to a letter grade based partly on the overall average of the
class. However, a score of 90% or better will guarantee some kind of an <b>A</b>, 80%
or better some sort of <b>B</b>, 70% or better a flavor of <b>C</b>, and 60% or better a <b>D</b>.
<p>
<p>
In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make<i>sure</i> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's<i>your</i> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's alot easier to read 100 pages in a week than it is
in a day. Try to do some mathematics every single day.
<b>Class attendance</b> is probably your best way to insure that you will keep 
up with the material, and make sure that you understand all of the
concepts. I will not be taking attendance; I expect that you will simply 
see the wisdom of attending class, for yourselves.

<p>

<b>Calculators</b> are terrific devices for finding (approximate) numerical
answers. However, the goal of this course is to teach you <i>how</i> to find
the answers, not to actually<i>get</i> the answers. And the numbers we will
typically be tossing around will be simple enough that using a calculator would
just get in the way. Consequently, you are requested not to use them, except
perhaps as a way to verify the correctness of your work. Get used to not using
them, however, because they will be specifically banned from most of our exams.

<b>Note:</b> In accordance with UNT policies, it is the responsibility of students with 
certified disabilities to provide the instructor with appropriate documentation 
from the Dean of Students Office.
