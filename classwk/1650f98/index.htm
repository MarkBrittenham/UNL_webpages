<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 1650 class
for Fall, 1998. Here you can find lists of <a href="hw.htm">homework assignments</a>, 
dates for <a href="exam.htm">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams,
an html-ized copy of the <a href="summ.htm">course summary</a>, and anything else that
might come up.</center>

<center>Some links that might be of general interest:</center>

<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/sosmath/">SOS Math</a> at the Univ. of 
Texas at El Paso offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://www.ping.be/~ping1339/hp.htm">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

A java-enhanced page which will allow you to zoom in on the 
<a href="http://www.math.unb.ca/%7Ewarp/beta/classes/frac/frac.html">Mandelbrot set</a>.
Seems a tad buggy, though.<p>

Everybody seems to have a 
<a href="http://www.escape.com/~paulg53/math/pi/links.html">pi page</a>. There are
several pages which will allow you to 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Science/Mathematics/
Numbers/Specific_Numbers/Pi/Search_Engines/">search</a> for your favorite string
of numbers in some very large number of digits of pi. For example, my (home) phone number
occurs beginning "at position 3619269 counting from the first digit after the 
decimal point".<p>
