<b>Office Hours:</b> (tentatively) Mo 11:00-12:00, Tu 10:00-11:00, 
We 3:00 - 4:00, and Th 11:00-12:00, and whenever you can find me in my office and I'm not 
horrendously busy. You are also quite welcome to make an appointment
for any other time; this is easiest to arrange just before or 
after class, or via email.

<p>
<b>Text:</b> <i>University Calculus</i>, 
by Hass, Weir, and Thomas (Addison-Wesley, 2007).

<p>
<br />This course, as the name is meant to imply, is a continuation of Calculus 
1. We will pick things up slightly before where that course left off, and 
essentially work our way through the second third of the text. In particular, we will cover 
the following chapters of the book (although not necessarily in this order):

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 6, Applications of Definite Integrals

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 7, Techniques of Integration

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 8, Infinite Sequences and Series

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 9, Polar Coordinates and Conics

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 10, Vectors and the Geometry of Space

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 11, Vector-valued functions and Motion in Space

<p>
<br /><b>Homework</b> will be assigned from each section, as we finish it. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics, we learn best by doing (again and again and ...). Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you should make sure you are understanding the
process of finding the solution, on your own - after 
all, you get to bring only one brain to exams (and it can't be someone 
else's). For the same reason, I also recommend that you try working 
each problem on your own, first. Some portion of the homework will 
be collected and graded; it will count 60 points toward your final grade

<p>
<b>Quizzes</b> will typically be held one day each week (probably Friday), 
at the end of class, unless 
that week includes an exam (in <i>our</i> class...). They will cover 
material presented in class through the previous Wednesday (or 
appropriate corresponding day). Your lowest two 
quiz grades will be dropped before computing your quiz score, which will count 
100 points toward your grade. A missed quiz will count as zero (and will therefore 
be the first grade dropped); a make-up quiz can be arranged only under the most 
unusual of circumstances.

<p>
<b>Midterm exams</b> will be given three times during the 
semester, in the evenings, from 7pm to 9pm. Specific dates
will be worked out at the beginning of the semester. 
Each exam will count 100 points toward your final grade. You can take a 
make-up exam only if there are compelling reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you to miss an exam. Make-up 
exams may be harder than the originals (because make-up exams 
are harder to write!). 

<p>
Finally, there will be a regularly scheduled <b>final exam</b>, on 
Thursday, December 18, from 10:00am to 12:00noon. 
It will cover the entire course, with a slight emphasis 
on material covered after the last midterm exam. It will count 
140 points toward your grade.

<p>
<br /><b>Your course grade</b> will be based upon this total of
60+ 100 + 3&times;100 + 140 = 600 points,
and will be converted to a letter grade, taking into account 
the overall average of the class. However, a score of 90% or 
better will guarantee some kind of <b>A</b>, 80% or better at 
least some sort of <b>B</b>, 70% or better at least a flavor of 
<b>C</b>, and 60% or better at least a <b>D</b>.

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Stay current!</b> In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make <u>sure</u> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's <u>your</u> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, and to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's a lot easier to read 50 pages in a week than it is
in a day. Try to do some mathematics every single day.
<b>Class attendance</b> is probably your best way to insure that you will keep 
up with the material, and make sure that you understand all of the
concepts. [And on a more pragmatic note, the intructor writes the exams, so it pays
to know what the instructor said!] Even more, <b>stay ahead!</b> You are strongly
encouraged to read the section to be covered in class prior to its presentation in 
lecture; this will both improve your ability to follow the lecture and help to focus your 
attention on any areas where extra effort on your part will be required.

<p>
<br /><b>Cell phones</b> should be silenced for the duration of all classes, and <u>extreme</u>
restraint should be exercised in answering a call during class. If you feel that you must 
answer a call, please excuse yourself from the room before beginning to take the call.

<p>
Due to the vast range of <b>calculators</b> available these days, with widely differing
capabilities, the use of calculators will not be allowed in quizzes or exams. 
In the end, it is not
<i>what</i> the answer is but <i>how we arrive at</i> the answer which will be most
important to us; so only the most routine arithmentic computations need to be carried
out before we will declare ourselves to ``have'' the answer to a problem.

<p>
The <b>Math Resource Center</b> is located in Avery 013B, and students in Math 106 are 
encouraged to use this resource if they have questions related to this course, or as a 
place to meet and discuss group projects.  
Hours for the MRC are MTWR 12:30 - 8:30 pm, F 12:30 - 2:30 pm, and Su 1:00 - 5:00pm.

<b>Departmental Grading Appeals Policy:</b> The Department of Mathematics does not 
tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, gender, 
religion or sexual orientation. If you believe you have been subject to such 
discrimination or harassment, in this or any math course, please contact the 
Department. If, for this or any other reason, you believe your grade was 
assigned incorrectly or capriciously, appeals may be made (in order) to the 
instructor, the Department Chair, the Departmental Grading Appeals Committee, 
the College Grading Appeals Committee, and the University Grading Appeals Committee.
