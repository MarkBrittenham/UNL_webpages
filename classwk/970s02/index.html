<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 970 class
for Spring, 2002. 

There are of course alot of textbooks
on topology out there, but the page I knew of that listed them doesn't exist anymore. On the
other hand, thanks largely to Mel Thornton, I now own most of them, so you can stop by my
office and look them over, if you want....<p>


The <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/topology/">Topology Atlas</a> is a huge database of 
(mostly research-level) information on
topology. It includes a page of <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/topology/educ.htm">lecture notes</a> in 
topology, for example.<p>

There is a fairly wide ranging discussion of 
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/54-XX.html">General Topology</a>
(i.e., point-set topology), which is part of a larger group of pages on the various
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/beginners.html#GEO">
divisions of mathematics</a>.<p>

More generally, there is the rather entertaining <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/">
Interactive Mathematics Miscellany</a> page. My favorite little tidbit so far has been
"[By the extreme value theorem,] for any object there is a distance at which it 
looks its best." (It took me a little while to figure out why that was actually true.)<p>

<!-- Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.htm">homework assignments</a>, -->
<!-- dates for <a href="exam.htm">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams, -->
<!-- an html-ized copy of the <a href="summ.htm">course summary</a>, and anything else that -->
<!-- might come up. -->
