This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 978 class
for Spring, 2003. There will be no main text for the course. The instructor will pull together topics 
from several sources, including:<p>

Colin Adams, <i>The Knot Book</i><br>

Ray Lickorish, <i>Introduction to Knot Theory</i><br>

Dale Rolfsen, <i>Knots and Links</i>

<p>

<a href="hw/">Here</a> is a page devoted to the homework sets.<p>

There are an immense number of resources for studying/doing knot theory available
on the web. Here are some of the ones that I have found useful and/or interesting:<p>

<a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/knotlink.htm">Knots on the Web</a> is a huge collection of links to
pages related to knots, both mathematical and otherwise.<br>

<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/mega-math/workbk/knot/knot.html">Untangling the Mathematics of Knots</a>, at
the <a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/mega-math/">MegaMath</a> website.<br>

<a href="http://www.geocities.com/aneziris/knots.htm">Theory of Knots and Links</a>, by Charilaos Aneziris. 
<a href="http://www.inst.bnl.gov/~wei/contents.html">Another set of pages</a>, focusing primarily on the theoretical tools for
knot tabulation.<br>

<p>
<p>

<b>Other links of a topological nature:</b>
<p>

The <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/topology/">Topology Atlas</a> is a huge database of 
(mostly research-level) information on
topology. It includes a page of <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/topology/educ.htm">lecture notes</a> in 
topology, for example.<br>

There is a fairly wide ranging discussion of 
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/54-XX.html">General Topology</a>
(i.e., point-set topology), which is part of a larger group of pages on the various
<a href="http://www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/papers/known-math/index/beginners.html#GEO">
divisions of mathematics</a>.<br>

More generally, there is the rather entertaining <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/">
Interactive Mathematics Miscellany</a> page. My favorite little tidbit so far has been
"[By the extreme value theorem,] for any object there is a distance at which it 
looks its best." (It took me a little while to figure out why that was actually true.)<br>

<!-- Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.htm">homework assignments</a>, -->
<!-- dates for <a href="exam.htm">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams, -->
<!-- an html-ized copy of the <a href="summ.htm">course summary</a>, and anything else that -->
<!-- might come up. -->
