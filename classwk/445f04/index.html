<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 445 class
for Fall, 2004. Here you can find copies of the
<a href="hw.html">homework assignments</a>, 
dates for <a href="exam.html">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams. 
You can download a copy of the course summary, in 
<a href="445fd.ps">Postscript</a> or <a href="445fd.pdf">PDF</a> format, or look
at <a href="445fd.html">an html-ized copy of the course summary</a>.</center>

<br>

<center>You can also find outlines of <a href="days/">each day's class</a>, describing what we covered
that day.</center>
<br>
<center>There are also <a href="maple/">Maple worksheets</a> available, which explore many of the concepts 
that we have encountered in class.</center>

<!--<center>I will also post, as they become available, scanned images of my <a href="notes.html">lecture notes</a>,
as PDF files.</center>

The current world record for the largest known prime number was <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/24036583.htm">discovered</a>
on May 15, 2004, as part of the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)</a>. It has <a href="http://mersenne.org/prime7.txt">7,235,733 digits</a>. The <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/20996011.htm">previous record</a> has 6,320,430 digits.<p>

In 2002, the first algorithm was found that <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/prove/prove4_3.html">determines if
a number is prime</a>, and which is known to run in polynomial time - in this case, the length of time required is on the order of
the number of digits of the number being tested, to the twelfth (12th) power.<p>

The <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/Seis.html">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>
will allow you to type in the first few terms of a sequence you suspect has a pattern, and will match it
against any known integer sequence in its database. Several published results have a search of this database
as an important initial component!<p>

Numbers of the form 2<sup>(2<sup>n</sup>)</sup>+1 which are prime are called <i>Fermat primes</i>;
they appear to be very rare. More generally, numbers of the form a<sup>(2<sup>n</sup>)</sup>+1 are
called (surprise) <i>generalized Fermat primes</i>. There are
<a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/yves.gallot/primes/results.html">some lists</a> of 
generalized Fermat primes for (relatively) small values of <b>a</b> and <b>n</b>. <p>

<a href="http://www.numbertheory.org/php/surd.html">This page</a> will compute the continued fraction
expansion of any quadratic irrational of reasonable size (e.g, the integer in the square root should be less than 10,000,000,000).<p>

<p>

<a href="http://www.mathematical.com/primelist1to100kk.html">This page</a> lists all of the prine numbers up to 10 million.

<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/sosmath/">SOS Math</a> at the Univ. of 
Texas at El Paso offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://www.ping.be/~ping1339/hp.htm">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

<a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/">Dan Sloughter</a> has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.karlscalculus.org/">Karl's Calculus Tutor</a> 
currently covers most of what would qualify as first-semester calculus, and some of the
second semester, as well.<p>

Forget a geometry formula? Check <a href="http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/">
this page</a> at Ask Dr. Math.<p>

A Java-enabled page for generating <a href="http://frankenstein.worldweb.net/donovan/cv/">
Pascal's triangle</a> (or rather, the last two digits of each entry, which is good enough
through the 24th line). What's the pattern of the even numbers in the triangle?!<p>
