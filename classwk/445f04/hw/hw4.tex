\item{16.} [NZM p.59, \# 56] Suppose $p$ is prime, and $x^2\equiv -2\pmod{p}$ .
By looking at the numbers $u+xv$ for $u,v$ in some range, show that at least one
of the equations

\ctln{$a^2+2b^2=p$ or $a^2+2b^2=2p$}

\item{} has a solution.

\bsk

\item{17.} [NZM p.60, \# 57]  Show that

\ssk

\ctln{$(a^2+2b^2)(c^2+2d^2) = (ac-2bd)^2+2(bc+ad)^2$}

\bsk

\item{18.} [NZM p.60, \# 58] Show that if $p$ is prime and odd and $a^2+2b^2=2p$ , then 
$a$ is even and $b$ is odd. Conclude that $b^2+2(a/2)^2=p$ is a solution in the integers.

\bsk

\item{19.} [NZM p.60, \# 59] Let $p$ be a prime factor of the number $a^2+2b^2$ . Show that if
$p\not | a$ or $p\not |b$ then the equation $x^2\equiv -2\pmod{p}$ has a solution.

\bsk

\item{20.} [NZM p.60, \# 60] Show that for any prime number $p$ , the equation $a^2+2b^2 = p$
has a solution $a,b$ $\Leftrightarrow$ the equation $x^2\equiv -2\pmod{p}$ has a solution $x$.
