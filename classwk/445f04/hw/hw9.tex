\item{40.} Find the rational solutions to the equation \hhsk $x^2+3y^2=7$


\bsk

\item{41.} Show that the equation \hhsk $13x^2+31y^2-71z^2=0$ \hhsk has no
non-trivial integer solutions.


\bsk

\item{42.} Show that the equation \hhsk $19x^2+31y^2-71z^2=0$ \hhsk has
non-trivial integer solutions.

\bsk

\item{43.} [NZM, p.240, \#\ 5.4.11] Show that for any prime modulus $p$, the
equation 

\ssk

\ctln{$(x^2-17)(x^2-19)(x^2-323) \equiv 0$ (mod $p$)}

\ssk

\item{} always has a solution.

\ssk

\item{} (N.B.: The result is also 
true for {\it any} modulus $n$; one makes use of Hensel's Lemma 
(p. 87 of NZM) to show it.)


\bsk

\item{44.} (NZM, p.260, \#\ 5.6.4)  Let $f(x,y)$ be a polynomial with
real coefficients and degree $d$, and set

\ssk

\ctln{$\displaystyle p(t) = (1+t^2)^d f({{2t}\over{1+t^2}},{{1-t^2}\over{1+t^2}})$}

\ssk

\item{} [Note: $\displaystyle ({{2t}\over{1+t^2}},{{1-t^2}\over{1+t^2}})$ is a popular
parametrization of the unit circle]. 

\ssk

\item{} Show that $p(t)$ is a polynomial, with degree at most $2d$. Conclude
that if ${\Cal C}_f({\Bbb R})$ meets the unit circle $\{(x,y)$ : $x^2+y^2=1\}$ in more than 
$2d$ points, then it {\it contains} the unit circle.
