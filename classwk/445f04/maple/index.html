<p>

Maple has a number theory package, which makes 
explorations of the concepts we have encountered
possible on even very large numbers. Here you will
find some worksheets that the instructor has found
useful. They were written on a variety of copies of
Maple, including versions 6, 7, and 9. The 
worksheets can be found <a href="mws/">here</a>. 
Since a  Maple 9 worksheet has a hard time running on a
previous version, the commands used are also 
available in text files <a href="txt/">here</a>.
