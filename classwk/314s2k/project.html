The goal of this project is to use a computer algebra system (such as Maple V or Matlab)
to find patterns in the probability distribution vectors arising from a Markov chain. 
Your write-ups will be due in class on <b>Thursday, March 30</b>.
<p>
The specific situation is this:
<p>
You, as founder and president of the Ace Marketing Analysis Group, have been hired
by daVinci's Pizza (dVP) to determine the best way to retarget their advertising 
campaign to 
steal market share from Domino's (DP) and Pizza Hut (PH). They plan a smear campaign, 
but can only 
afford to target one of the two. Currently, their analysis indicates that, each 
week, 50% of their customers remain loyal to dVP (i.e., return the 
following week), while 30% will switch to 
DP and the remainder to PH. Their spies within the other corporations tell them that
45% of DP customers remain loyal each week, while 35% switch to dVP, and 40%
of PH customers stick with PH, while 30% switch to dVP. The people at daVinci's
feel that, using the same amount of money, they can:
<p>

(a) convince an additional 10% of their current customers, that would ordinarily 
switch to Domino's, to instead remain loyal;
<p>

or
<p>

(b) convince an additional 10% of their current customers, that would ordinarily 
switch to Pizza Hut, to instead remain loyal;
<p>

or
<p>

(c) convince an additional 10% of Domino's customers, that would ordinarily 
remain loyal, to instead switch to daVinci's;
<p>

or
<p>

(d) convince an additional 10% of Pizza Hut's customers, that would ordinarily 
remain loyal, to instead switch to daVinci's.
<p>

What they wish you to determine is: which of these strategies will give them
the greatest market share in the long run?
<p>

To answer this, you should set up each of these four scenarios as a Markov chain,
identifying the transition matrix for each. For comparison (and to show daVinci's
what kind of market advantage their money will be buying) you might also set
up the original data from before their planned smear campaign. Then look at
what happens to the market share for each company under successive iterations
of your transition matrices. Sample <i>Maple V</i> code for carrying out such calculations
can be found on our course web page:

<p>
You are not provided with data on the original market share for each franchise
at the begining of the campaign; by choosing several initial examples to 
start with (e.g., all with daVinci's, all with Domino's, etc.), explore how 
sensitive your estimates of eventual (i.e., after many iterations) market share
are to such changes in initial shares.
<p>

Then, with your success in showing daVinci's how to spend their advertising money, 
sit back and watch the dough roll in.
<p>

Your final report to the board of directors of daVinci's Pizza 
should include a summary of the techniques you used
to reach your conclusions; make sure to include sufficient detail and 
explanatory material
to make your work understandable to someone with a basic knowledge of 
linear algebra, but who does not have a knowledge of the specific techniques
you employed in your analysis. I expect that a good job of it 
can be done in under 5 pages, but would 
probably need more than 2?
<p>
You may choose to work on this project individually, or to work with some 
of your fellow students,
in groups of up to three in size. Each group need only turn in one report, 
headed by all of 
the names of your consulting team. 
<p>


(P.S.: `Market share' means the fraction of the total number of customers that each 
pizza place serves.)
