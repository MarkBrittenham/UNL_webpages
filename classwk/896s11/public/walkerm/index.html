<b>Title: What is K-theory?</b><br>

Subtitle: Were A through J taken?<p>



K-theory comes in two main flavors: algebraic and
topological. Part of the beauty of the subject is the rich
interplay between ideas coming from algebra and ideas coming
from topology. I will try to convey a sense of this richness
by giving an introduction to the notion of a "vector bundle", both the
algebraic and topological kind.<p>
