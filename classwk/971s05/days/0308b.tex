We typically think of building a $\Delta$-complex $X$ inductively. 
The {\it 0-simplices}
(i.e., points), or {\it vertices}, form the 0-skeleton 
$X^{(0)}$. $n$-simplices $\sigma^n = [v_0,\ldots v_n]$ attach 
to the $(n-1)$-skeleton
to form the $n$-skeleton $X^{(n)}$; the restriction
of the attaching map to each face of $\sigma^n$ is, by definition,
an $(n-1)$-simplex in $X$. The attaching map is (by induction)
really determined by a map $\{v_0,\ldots ,v_n\}\ra X^{(0)}$, since this 
determines the attaching maps for the 1-simplices in the boundary of the
$n$-simplex, which 
gives 1-simplices in $X$, which then give the attaching maps for
the 2-simplices in the boundary, etc. Note that the reverse is not true;
the vertices of two different $n$-simplices in $X$ can be the same.
For example, think of the 2-sphere as a pair of 2-simplices whose 
boundaries are glued by the identity. 

\msk

The final detail that we need before defining (simplicial) homology
groups is the notion of an {\it orientation} on a simplex of $X$.
Each simplex $\sigma^n$ is determined by a map 
$f:\{v_0,\ldots ,v_n\}\ra X^{(0)}$; an orientation on $\sigma^n$ is an
(equivalence class of) the ordered $(n+1)$-tuple $(f(v_0),\ldots f(v_n)) = (V_0,\ldots ,V_n)$.
Another ordering of the
same vertices represents the same orientation if there is an {\it even} permutation
taking the entries of the first $(n+1)$-tuple to the second. This should be thought 
of as a generalization of the right-hand rule for ${\Bbb R}^3$, interpreted as
orienting the vertices of a 3-simplex. Note that there are precisely two
orientations on a simplex.

\msk

Now to define homology! We start by defining $n$-{\it chains};
these are (finite) formal linear combinations of the (oriented!) $n$-simplices
of $X$, where $-\sigma$ is interpreted as $\sigma$ with the opposite
(i.e., other) orientation. Adding formal linear combinations formally,
we get the $n$-th {\it chain group} 
$C_n(X) = \{\sum n_\alpha \sigma_\alpha$ : $\sigma_\alpha$ an oriented $n$-simplex in $X\}$ .
We next define a {\it boundary operator} $\del:C_n(X)\ra C_{n-1}(X)$, whose image will be 
the $(n-1)$-chains that are the ``boundaries'' of $n$-chains. We define it on the basis
elements $\sigma_\alpha = \sigma$ of $C_n(X)$ as
$\del\sigma = \sum (-1)^i\sigma|_{[v_0,\ldots,\widehat{v_{i}},\ldots ,v_n]}$ , 
where $\sigma:[v_0,\ldots ,v_n]\ra X$ is the characteristic map of $\sigma_\alpha$ .
$\del\sigma$ is therefore an alternating sum of the faces of $\sigma$. 
The pont that really make this definition
go is that we need {\it oriented} simplices, so that we know what the $i$-th face
of $\sigma$ is (the one oppoisite the $i$-th vertex).
We then extend the definition by linearity to all of $C_n(X)$. When a notation indicating
dimension is needed, we write $\del=\del_n$ . We define $\del_0=0$.

\msk

This definition is cooked up to make the maxim ``boundaries have no boundary'' true;
that is $\delta_{n-1}\circ \delta_n = 0$, the $0$ map. This is because, for any simplex
$\sigma = [v_0,\ldots v_n]$, 

\msk

$\displaystyle \delta\circ\delta(\sigma) = 
\delta(\sum_{i=0}^n  (-1)^i\sigma|_{[v_0,\ldots,\widehat{v_{i}},\ldots ,v_n]})$

= $\displaystyle (\sum_{j<i}(-1)^j(-1)^i\sigma|_{[v_0,\ldots,\widehat{v_{j}},\ldots,\widehat{v_{i}},\ldots ,v_n]})
+(\sum_{j>i}(-1)^{j-1}(-1)^i\sigma|_{[v_0,\ldots,\widehat{v_{i}},\ldots,\widehat{v_{j}},\ldots ,v_n]})$

\msk

The distinction between the two pieces is that in the second part, $v_j$ is actually the $(j-1)$-st vertex
of the face. Switching the roles of $i$ and $j$ in the second sum, we find that the two are
negatives of one another, so they sum to $0$, as desired.

\msk

And this little calculation is all that it takes to define homology groups! What this tells 
us is that im$(\delta_{n+1})\subseteq\ker(\delta_{n}$ for every $n$. 
$\ker(\delta_{n}=Z_n(X)$ are called the {\it $n$-cycles} of $X$; they are the $n$-chains with
$0$ (i.e., empty) boundary. They form a (free) abelian subgroup of $C_n(X)$. 
im$(\delta_{n+1} = B_n(X)$ are the {\it $n$-boundaries} of $X$; they are, of course,
the boundaries of $(n+1)$-chains in $X$. The $n$-th homology group of $X$,
$H_n(X)$ is the quotient $Z_n(X)/B_n(X)$ ; it is an abelian group.

\msk

A key observation is that the boundary maps $\delta_n$ are linear, that is,
they are homomorphisms between the free abelian groups 
$\delta_n:C_n(X)\ra C_{n-1}(X)$. Consequently, they can be expressed as
(integer-valued) matrices $\Delta_n$. Row reducing $\Delta_n$ 
(over the integers!) allows us to find a 
basis $v_1,\ldots ,v_k$ for $Z_n(X)$ (clearing denomenators
to get vectors over ${\Bbb Z}$). Then since $\Delta_n\Delta_{n+1}=0$, the
columns of $\Delta_{n+1}$ are in the kernel of $\Delta_n$, so can be
expressed as linear combinations of the $v_i$ . These combinations can be
determined by row reducing the augmented matrix
$( v_1\cdots v_k | \Delta_{n+1} )$ . This will row reduce to 
$\pmatrix I&|&C\\ 0&|&0\\ \endpmatrix$, and $C$ basically describes the boundaries
$B_n(X)$ in terms of the basis $v_1,\ldots ,v_k$ . The homology group
$H_n(X)$ is then the {\it cokernel} of $C$, i.e., ${\Bbb Z}^k/$im$C$ .
Note that $C$ will have integer entries, since we know that 
the columns of $\Delta_{n+1}$ can be expressed as integer linear
combinations of the $v_i$, and, being a basis, there is only
one such expression. 

\msk

For example, the Klein bottle $K$ has a $\Delta$-complex structure with 2 2-simplices,
3 1-simplices, and 1 0-simplex; we will call them 
$f_1=[0,1,2],f_2=[1,2,3],
e_1=[0,2]=[1,3],e_2=[1,0]=[2,3],e_3=[1,2]$, 
and $v_1=[0]=[1]=[2]=[3]$.
Computing, we find 
$\del_2 f_1 = \del[0,1,2]=[1,2]-[0,2]+[0,1]=e_3-e_1-e_2$ , $\del_2 f_2 = e_2-e_1+e_3$ , 
$\del_1 e_1 = \del_1 e_2 = \del_1 e_3 = 0$ and $\del_i = 0$ for all other $i$
(as well). So we have the chain complex

$\cdots \ra 0 \ra {\Bbb Z}^2 \ra {\Bbb Z}^3 \ra {\Bbb Z} \ra 0$

and all of the boundary maps are 0, except for $\del_2$, which has the matrix
$\pmatrix
 -1&-1\\ -1&1\\ 1&1\\
\endpmatrix$ . This matrix is injective, so $\ker \del_2 = 0$,
so $H_2(K)=0$, on the other hand, $H_1(K)$ = coker$(\del_2)$, and applying column
operations we can transform the matrix for $\del_2$ to $\pmatrix 1&0\\ 1&2\\ -1&0\\ \endpmatrix$,
which implies that the cokernel is ${\Bbb Z}\oplus{\Bbb Z}_2$, since 
$\pmatrix 1\\ 1\\ -1\\ \endpmatrix ,\pmatrix 0\\ 1\cr 0\\ \endpmatrix , \pmatrix 0\cr 0\\ 1\\ \endpmatrix$
is a basis for ${\Bbb Z}^3$. Finally, $H_0(K)={\Bbb Z}$, since $\del_1,\del_0=0$,
and all higher homology groups are also $0$, for the same reason.

\msk

As another example, the topologist's dunce hat has a $\Delta$-structure with
1 2-simplex, 1 1-simplex, and 1 0-simplex. The boundary maps, we can work out
(starting from $C_2(X)$ ), are $(1),(0)$, and $(0)$, so $H_2(X)=H_1(X)=0$,
and $H_0(X)={\Bbb Z}$. all higher groups are also $0$.

\msk

These homology groups are, in the end, fairly routine to calculate from a 
$\Delta$-complex structure. But there is one very large problem; the calculations
\u{depend} on the $\Delta$ structure! This is not a group defined from the space
$X$; it is defined from the space and a $\Delta$ structure on it. A priori, we don't
know that if we chose a different structure on the same space, that we would get
isomorphic groups! We should really denote our groups by $H_i^\Delta(X)$, to 
acknowledge this dependence on the structure.

\bsk

But we don't {\it want} a group that depends on this structure. We want groups that
just depend on the topological space $X$, i.e., which are topological invariants.
In really turns out that these groups $H_i^\Delta(X)$ \u{are} topological invariants,
but we will need to take a very roundabout route to show this. What we will do
now is to define another sequence $H_i(X)$ of groups, the {\it singular homology
groups}, which their definition makes apparent from the outset 
that they are topological invariants.
But this definition will also make it very unclear how to really compute them! 
Then we will show that for $\Delta$-complexes these two sequences of groups
are really the same. In so doing, we will have built a sequence of topological
invariants that for a large class of spaces are fairly routine to compute. Then
all we will need to show is that they also capture useful information about
a space (i.e., we can prove useful theorems with them!).

\msk

And the basic idea behind defining them is that, with simplicial homology,
we have already done all of the hard work. What we do is, as before, build a 
sequence of (free) abelian groups, the chain groups $C_n(X)$, 
and boundary maps between them,
with consecutive maps composing to 0. Then, as before, the homology groups are
kernels mod images, i.e., cycles mod boundaries. And, as before, the basis
elements for each of our chain groups $C_n(X)$ will be the $n$-simplices
in $X$. But now $X$ is \u{any} topological space. So how do we get $n$-simplices
in such a space? We do the only thing we can; we {\it map} them in. 

\msk

More precisely, we work with {\it singular $n$-chains}, that is,
formal (finite) linear combinations $\sum a_i\sigma_i$, where $a_i\in{Bbb Z}$
and the $\sigma_i$ are {\it singular simplices}, that is, (continuous) 
maps $\sigma_i:\Delta^n\ra X$ from the (standard) $n$-simplex into $X$.
The boundary maps are really exactly as before; they are the alternating sum of
the restrictions of $\sigma_i$ to the $n+1$ faces of $\Delta^n$ . (Formally,
we must precompose these face maps with the (orientation-preserving) linear
isomorphism from the standard $(n-1)$-simplex to each of the faces, preserving
the ordering of their vertices.) The same proof as before (except that we interpret
the faces as restrictions of the map $\sigma_i$, instead of as physical faces)
shows that the composition of two successive boundaries are 0,
and so all of the machinery is in place to define the {\it singular homology
groups} $H_i(X)$ as the kernel of $\del_i$ modulo the image of $\del_{i+1}$ = $Z_i(X)/B_i(X)$ .
They are, by their definition, groups defined using the topological space $X$ as input,
and so are topological invariants of $X$. The elements are equivalence classes of $i$-cycles,
where $z_1\sim z_2$ if $z_1-z_2=\del w$ for some $(i+1)$-chain $w$ . We say that $z_1$ and $z_2$ are
{\it homologous}.

\msk

The fun comes when you try to compute them. 
$C_n(X) = \{\sum a_i\sigma_i$ : $a_i\in {\Bbb Z}$ and $\sigma_i:\Delta^n\ra X$ 
is continuous$\}$ is typically a \u{huge} group, since there will be immense
numbers of maps $\Delta^n\ra X$ . About the only space for which this is not true is
the one-point space $*$; then there are, for each $n$, exactly one (distinct)
map $\sigma_n :\Delta^n\ra *$ ; the constant map. Therefore each face of $\Delta^n$
gives the same restriction map $\sigma^{n-1}$, and so the boundary maps can 
be dirctly computed (the depend on the parity of the number $n+1$ of faces 
an $n$-simplex has). We find that $\del_{2n}=Id$ and $\del_{2n-1}=0$ . so in 
computing homology groups, we either have kernel everything ($\del_i=0$) and
image everything ($\del_{i+1}=Id$) or kernel nothing ($\del_i=Id$) and
image nothing ($\del_{i+1}=0$), so in both cases $H_i(*)=0$ . Except for $i=0$;
then $\del_0=0$ (by definition) and $\del_1=0$, so $H_0(*)={\Bbb Z}$ .
But other than this example (and, well, OK, spaces with the discrete topology;
it's the same calculation as above for every point!), computing singular 
homology from the definition is quite a chore! so we need to build
some labor-saving devices, namely, some theorems to help us break the problem
of computing these groups into smaller, more managable pieces.

\msk

First set of managable pieces: if we decompose $X$ into its path components, $X=\bigcup X_\alpha$,
then $H_i(X) \cong \bigoplus H_i(X_\alpha)$ for every $i$. This is because every singular simplex,
since $\Delta^i$ is path-connected, maps into some $X_\alpha$ . So $C_i(X) \cong \bigoplus C_i(X_\alpha)$.
Since the boundary of a simplex mapping into $X_\alpha$ consists of simplices in $X_\alpha$, the 
boundary maps respect the decomposistions of the chain groups, so 
$B_i(X) \cong \bigoplus B_i(X_\alpha)$ and $Z_i(X) \cong \bigoplus Z_i(X_\alpha)$, and so 
the quotients are $H_i(X) \cong \bigoplus H_i(X_\alpha)$ . 

\msk

So, if we wish to, we can focus on computing homology groups for path-connected spaces $X$. For such a space, 
$H_0(X)\cong {\Bbb Z}$, generated by any map of a 0-simplex (= a point) into $X$. This is because any pair
of 0-simplices are homologous; given any two points $x,y\in X$, there is a path $\gamma: I\ra X$ from $x$ to $y$,
This path can be interpreted as a singular 1-simplex, and $\del\gamma = y-x$ . So $H_0(X)$ is generated
by a single point $[x]$ . No multiple of this point is null-homologous, because for any 1-chain $\sum n_i \sigma_i$,
the sum of the coefficients of its boundary is 0 (since this is true for each singular 1-simplex), and any 0-chain
$\sum n_i [x_i]$ is homologous to $(\sum n_i)[x]$ by the above argument.

\msk

Perhaps the most important property of the fundamental group is that a continuouos map 
between spaces induces a homomorphism between groups. (This implied, for instance,
that homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic \mpu ). The same is true for homology groups, 
for essentially the same reason. Given a map $f:X\ra Y$, there is an induced map $f_\#:C_n(X)\ra C_n(Y)$
defined by postcomposition; for a singular simplex $\sigma$, $f_\#(\sigma) = f\circ\sigma$, and we extend
the map linearly. Since $f\circ(g|_A) = (f\circ g)|_A$ (postcomposition commutes with restriction of the domain),
$f_\#$ commutes with $\del$ : $f_\#(\del \sigma) = \del(f_\#(\sigma))$. A homomorphism between
chain complexes (i.e., a sequence of such maps, one for each chain group) which commutes with the 
boundaries maps in this way, is called a {\it chain map}.
A chain map, such as $f_\#$, therefore, takes cycles to cycles,
and boundaries to boundaries, and so $f_\#:Z_i(X)\ra Z_i(Y)$ (which is linear, hence a homomorphism)
induces a homomorphism $f_*:H_i(X)\ra H_i(Y)$ by $f_*[z] = [f_\#(z)]$ . 
Since it is defined by composition with singular simplices, it is 
immediate that, for a map $g:Y\ra Z$, $(g\circ f)_*=g_*\circ f_*$ . And since the identity map $I:X\ra X$
satisfies $I_\#=Id$, so $I_*=Id$, homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic homology groups.

\msk

Another important property of \mpu\ is that homotopic maps give the same
induced map (after correcting for basepoints). This is also true for homology;
if $f\sim g:X\ra Y$, then $f_*=g_*$ . The proof, however, is not quite as straightforward
as for homotopy. And it requires some new technology; the chain homotopy.
A chain homotopy $H$ between the chain complexes $f_\#,g_\#:C_*(X)\ra C_*(Y)$ 
is a sequence of homomorphisms $H_i:C_i(X)\ra C_{i+1}(Y)$ satisfying
$H_{i-1}\del_i+\del_{i+1}H_i = f_\#-g_\#:C_i(X)\ra C_i(Y)$ . The existence of $H$
implies that $f_*=g_*$, since for an $i$-cycle $z$ (with $\del_i(z)=0$) we have

$f_*[z]-g_*[z] = [f_\#(z)-g_\#(z)] = [H_{i-1}\del_i(z)+\del_{i+1}H_i(z)] = [H_{i-1}(0)+\del_{i+1}(w)]
=[\del_{i+1}(w)]=0$.

And the existence of a homotopy between $f$ and $g$ implies the existence of a 
chain homotopy between $f_\#$ and $g_\#$ . This is because the homotopy 
gives a map $H:X\times I\ra Y$, which induces a map $H_\#:C_{i+1}(X\times I)\ra C_{i+1}(Y)$ .
Then we pull, from our back pocket, a {\it prism map}
$P:C_i(X)\ra C_{i+1}(X\times I)$; the composition $H_\#\circ P$ will be our chain homotopy.
The prism map  takes a (singular) $i$-simplex $\sigma$ and sends it to a sum of singular $(i+1)$-simplices
in $X\times I$. and the way we define it is to take the $i$-simplex $\Delta^i$, and taking it 
to $\Delta^i\times I$ (i.e., a {\it prism}), and thinking of this as a sum of $(i+1)$-simplices. Using the
map $\sigma\times Id : \Delta^i\times I\ra X\times I$ restricted to each of these $(i+1)$-simplices
yields the prism map. Now, there are many ways of decomposing a prism into simplices,
but we need to be careful to choose one which restricts well to each of the \u{faces} of $\Delta^i$,
in order to get the chain homotopy property we require. In the end, what this requires is that the
decomposition, when restricted to any face of $\Delta^i$ (which we think of as a copy
of $\Delta^{i-1}$), is the same as the decomposition we would have applied to a prism over
an $(i-1)$-simplex.
