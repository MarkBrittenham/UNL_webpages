We have so far introduced two homologies; simplicial, $H_*^\Delta$, whose computation 
``only'' required some linear algebra,
and singular, $H_*$, which is formally less difficult to work with, and which, you may suspect by now, is also becoming
less difficult to compute... For $\Delta$-complexes, these homology groups are the same, $H_n^\Delta(X)\cong H_n(X)$
for every $X$. In fact, the isomorphism is induced by the inclusion $C_n^\Delta(X)\sset C_n(X)$. And we have
now assembled all of the tools necessary to prove this. Or almost; we need to note that most of the edifice we
have built for singular homology \u{could} have been built for simplicial homology, including relative 
homology (for a sub-$\Delta$-complex $A$ of $X$), and a SES of chain groups, giving a LES sequence for the pair,

\ssk

$\cdots \ra H_n^\Delta(A) \ra H_n^\Delta(X) \ra H_n^\Delta(X,A) \ra H_{n-1}^\Delta(A) \ra \cdots$

\ssk

The proof of the isomorphism between the two homologies proceeds by first showing that the
inclusion induces an isomorphism on $k$-skeleta, $H_n^\Delta(X^{(k)})\cong H_n(X^{(k)})$,
and this goes by induction on $k$ using the Five Lemma applied to the diagram

\ssk

\ctln{$\displaystyle 
\matrix 
H_{n+1}^\Delta(X^{(k)},X^{(k-1)})&\ra&H_n^\Delta(X^{(k-1)})&\ra&H_n^\Delta(X^{(k)}) & \ra & H_{n}^\Delta(X^{(k)},X^{(k-1)}) & \ra & H_{n-1}^\Delta(X^{(k-1)})\cr
\downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & \cr
H_{n+1}(X^{(k)},X^{(k-1)})&\ra&H_n(X^{(k-1)})&\ra&H_n(X^{(k)}) & \ra & H_{n}(X^{(k)},X^{(k-1)}) & \ra & H_{n-1}(X^{(k-1)}) \cr
\endmatrix$}

\ssk

The second and fifth vertical arrows are, by an inductive hypothesis, isomorphisms. The first and fourth vertical arrows are
isomorphisms because, essentially, we can, in each case, identify these groups. 
$H_{n}(X^{(k)},X^{(k-1)})\cong H_{n}(X^{(k)}/X^{(k-1)})\cong \widetilde{H}_n(\vee S^k)$
are either 0 (for $n\neq k$) or $\oplus \bbz$ (for $n=k$), one summand for each $n$-simplex in $X$. 
But the same is true for $H_{n}^\Delta(X^{(k)},X^{(k-1)})$; and for $n=k$ the generators are precisely
the $n$-simplices of $X$. The inclusion-induced map takes generators to generators, so is an isomorphism.
\hhsk So by the Five Lemma, the middle rows are also isomorphisms, completing our inductive proof.

\ssk

Returning to $H_n^\Delta(X) {\buildrel {I_*}\over \ra} H_n(X)$, we wish now to show that this map is an isomorphism.
Any $[z]\in H_n(X)$ is represented by a cycle $z=\sum a_i\sigma_i$ for $\sigma_i:\Delta^n\ra X$ . But each
$\sigma_i(\Delta^n)$ is a compact subset of $X$, and so meets only finitely-many cells of $X$. This is true for every
singular simplex, and so there is a $k$ for which all of the simplices map into $X^{(k)}$, and so we may
treat $z\in C_n(X^{(k)}$. Thought of in this way, it is still a cycle, and so $[z]\in H_n(X^{(k)})\cong H_n^\Delta(X^{(k)})$
so there is a $z^\prime in C_n^\Delta(X^{(k)})$ and a $w\in C_{n+1}(X^{(k)})$ with $i_\#z^\prime -z=\del w$. 
But thinking of  $z^\prime in C_n^\Delta(X)$ and $w\in C_{n+1}(X)$, we have the same equality, so 
$[z^\prime] \in H_n^\Delta(X)$ and $i_*[z^\prime] = [z]$ . So $i_*$ is surjective.
If $i_*([z]) = 0$, then the cycle $z=\sum a_i\sigma_i$ is a sum of characteristic maps of $n$-simplices of $X$, and
so can be thought of as an element of $C_n^\Delta(X^{n)})$ . Being $0$ in $H_n(X)$, $z=\del w$ for some
$w\in C_{n+1}(X)$ . But as before, $w\in C_n(X^{r)})$ for some $r$, and so thought of as an element of 
the image of the isomorphism $i_*: H_n^\Delta(X^{(r)})\ra H_n(X^{(r)})$, $i_*([z])=0$, so $[z]=0$ . So 
$z=\del u$ for some $u\in C_{n+1}^\Delta(X^{r)})\sset C_{n+1}^\Delta(X)$ . So $[z]=0$ in $H_n^\Delta(X)$.
Consequently, simplicial and singular homology groups are isomorphic.

Some topological results with homological proofs: The Klein bottle and real projective plane cannot 
embed in $\bbr^3$. This is because a surface $\Sigma$ embedded in $\bbr^3$ has a (the proper word is {\it normal})
neighborhood $N(\Sigma)$, which deformation retracts to $\Sigma$; literally, it is all points within a (uniformly) short distance
in the normal direction from the point on the surface $\Sigma$. Our non-embeddedness result follows (by contradiction)
from applying Mayer-Vietoris to the pair $(A,B) = (\overline{N(\Sigma)},\overline{\bbr^3\setminus N(\Sigma)})$, whose intersection
is the boundary $F=\del N(\Sigma)$ of the normal neighborhood. The point, though, is that
$F$ is an orientable surface; the outward normal (pointing away from $N(\Sigma)$) at every point, taken as
the first vector of a right-handed orientation of $\bbr^3$ allows us to use the other two vectors as an 
orientation of the surface. So $F$ is one of the surface $F_g$ above whose homologies we just computed.
This gives the LES
\hhsk
$\wtih_2(\bbr^3) \ra \wtih_1(F) \ra \wtih_1(A)\oplus \wtih_1(B)\ra \wtih_1(\bbr ^3)$
\hhsk 
which renders as 
\hhsk
$0\ra\bbz^{2g}\ra \wtih(\Sigma)\oplus G\ra 0$
\hhsk , i.e., \hhsk
$\bbz^{2g}\cong \wtih(\Sigma)\oplus G$ 
\hhsk . But for the Klein bottle and projective plane (or any closed, non-orientable
surface for that matter), $\wtih_1(\Sigma)$ has torsion, so it cannot be the direct
summand of a torsion-free group! So no such embedding exists.

\msk

Another: if ${\Bbb R}^n\cong {\Bbb R}^m$, via $h$, then $n=m$ .
This is because we can arrange, by composing with a translation, that $h(0)=0$, and then 
we have 
$({\Bbb R}^n,{\Bbb R}^n\setminus 0)\cong {\Bbb R}^m,({\Bbb R}^m\setminus 0)$, which gives


\ssk

\ctln{$\widetilde{H}_i(S^{n-1})\cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^n,\del {\Bbb D}^n) \cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^n,{\Bbb D}^n\setminus 0)
\cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb R}^n,{\Bbb R}^n\setminus 0) \cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb R}^m,{\Bbb R}^m\setminus 0)$}

\ctln{$\cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^m,{\Bbb D}^m\setminus 0) \cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^m,\del {\Bbb D}^m)
\cong \widetilde{H}_i(S^{m-1})$}

\ssk

Setting $i=n-1$ gives the result, since $\widetilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{m-1})\cong {\Bbb Z}$ implies $n-1=m-1$ .

\msk

More generally, we can establish a result which is known as {\it invariance of domain},
a result which is useful in both topology and analysis.

\msk

{\bf Invariance of Domain:} If ${\Cal U}\subseteq {\Bbb R}^n$ and $f:{\Cal U}\ra {\Bbb R}^n$
is continuous and injective, then $f({\Cal U})\subseteq {\Bbb R}^n$ is open.

\msk

Note it is enough to proof this for our favorite open set, which in this context will be ${\Cal V}=(-1,1)^n\subseteq {\Bbb R}^n$,
since given any open ${\Cal U}$ and $x\in{\Cal U}$, we can find an injective linear map $h:(-1,1)^n\ra {\Cal U}$
taking $0$ to $x$. If we can show that $f\circ h$ has open image, then $f(x)\in f\circ h({\Cal V})\subseteq f({\Cal U})$
shows that $f(x)$ has an open neighborhood in $f({\Cal U})$ . Since $x$ is arbitrary, $f({\Cal U})$ is open.

\msk

\bsk

\msk

This in turn implies the ``other'' invariance of domain; if $f: {\Bbb R}^n\ra {\Bbb R}^m$ is continuous and injective, then
$n\leq m$, since if not, then composition of $f$ with the inclusion $i:{\Bbb R}^m\ra {\Bbb R}^n$, $i(x_1,\ldots ,x_m) = 
(x_1,\ldots ,x_m,0,\ldots ,0)$ is injective and continuous with non-open image (it lies in a hyperplane in ${\Bbb R}^n$),
a contradiction.


\bsk

Our next goal is to show that,
when both make sense, simplicial and singular homology are
isomorphic. In fact, the inclusion of the simplicial chain groups into the 
singular ones induces an isomorphism on homology.

A map of pairs $f: (X,A) \ra (Y,B)$ (meaning that $f(A)\subseteq B$)
induces (by postcomposition) a map of relative homology $f_*:H_i(X,A)\ra H_i(Y,B)$ , just as with 
absolute homology.
We also get a homotopy-invariance result: if $f,g: (X,A) \ra (Y,B)$ are maps of pairs
which are {\it homotopic as maps of pairs},
i.e., there is a map $(X\times I,A\times I)\ra (Y,B)$ which is $f$ on one end and $g$
on the other, then $f_*=g_*$ . The proof is identical to the one given before; the prism map 
$P$ sends chains in $A$ to chains in $A$, so induces a map $C_i(X\times I,A\times I)\ra C_{i+1}(X,A)$
which does precisely what we want.
