In the end, the big result that allows us to get our homology machine really running is what is
known as {\it excision}. To motivate it, let's try to imagine that we are trying to 
generalize Seifert - van Kampen. We start with $X=A\cup B$, and we want to try to 
express the homology of $X$ in terms of that of $A$, $B$, and $A\cap B$. With our
new-found tool of long exact homology sequences, we might try to first build
a short exact sequence out of the chain complexes $C_*(A\cap B), C_*(A), C_*(B)$, and $C_*(X)$.
If we take our cue from the \u{proof} of S-vK, we might think of chains in $X$ as sums of 
chains in $A$ and $B$, except that we mod out by chains in $A\cap B$. Putting this into action,
we might try the sequence

\ssk

\ctln{$0\ra C_n(A\cap B) \ra C_n(A)\oplus C_n(B) \ra C_n(X) \ra 0$}

\ssk

where $j_n:C_n(A)\oplus C_n(B) \ra C_n(X)$ is defined as $j_n(a,b)=a+b$ . In order to get exactness
at the middle term (i.e., image = the kernel of this map, which is $\{ (x,-x) : x\in C_n(A)\cap C_n(B)\}$),
we set $i_n:C_n(A\cap B) \ra C_n(A)\oplus C_n(B)$ to be $i_n(x) = (x,-x)$ , since
$C_n(A\cap B) = C_n(A)\cap C_n(B)$ ! $i_n$ is then injective, and we certainly have that
this sequence is exact at the middle term. But, in general, $j_n$ is far from surjective! The image of $j_n$
is the set of $n$-chains that can be expressed as sums of chains in $A$ and $B$. Which of course
not every chain in $X$ can be; singular simplices in $X$ need not map entirely
into either $A$ or $B$. 

\msk

We can solve this by \u{replacing} $C_n(X)$ with the image of $j_n$, calling it, say,
$C_n^{\{A,B\}}(X)$ ... [Note: these groups \u{would} form a chain complex!]
Then we have a short exact sequence, and hence a long exact homology sequence.
But it involves a ``new'' homology group $H_n^{\{A,B\}}(X)$ . The \u{point} is that, like S-vK,
under the right conditions, this new homology is the same as $H_n(X)$ !

\msk

Starting from scratch, the idea is that, starting with an {\it open cover} $\{{\Cal U}_\alpha\}$
of $X$ (or, more generally, with a collections of subspaces $A_\alpha$ whose interiors 
${\Cal U}_\alpha$ cover $X$), we build the {\it chain groups subordinate to the cover} 
$C_n^{\Cal U}(X) = \{\sum a_i \sigma_i^n : \sigma_i : n:\Delta^n\ra X , \sigma_i^n(\Delta^n)\subseteq {\Cal U}_\alpha$
for some $\alpha\}$ $\subseteq$ $C_n(X)$ . 
Since the face of any simplex mapping into ${\Cal U}_\alpha$ also maps into ${\Cal U}_\alpha$,
our ordinary boundary maps induce boundary maps on these groups, turning
$(C_n^{\Cal U}(X),\partial_n)$ into a chain complex. Our main result is that the inclusion
$i$ of these groups into $C_n(X)$ induces an isomophism on homology. And to show this, we (could) once
again use the notion of a chain homotopy.

\msk

{\bf Theorem:} There is a chain map $b:C_n(X)\ra C_n^{\Cal U}(X)$ so that $i\circ b$ and $b\circ i$ are both chain 
homotopic to the identity. $i$ consequently induces isomorphisms on homology.

\msk

But we won't prove it quite that way! Another approach is to use the short exact sequence of chain 
complexes

\ssk

\ctln{$0 \ra C_n^{\Cal U}(X) {\buildrel i\over \ra} C_n(X) \ra C_n(X)/C_n^{\Cal U}(X) \ra 0$}

\ssk

to build a long exact homology sequence. Every third group is $H_n(C_*(X)/C_*^{\Cal U}(X))$ ;
if we show that these groups are $0$, then $i_*$ will be an isomorphism. And to show \u{this},
working back through the definition of homology classes in $H_n(C_*(X)/C_*^{\Cal U}(X))$,
we need to show that if $z\in C_n(X)$ with $\del z\in C_{n-1}^{\Cal U}(X)$ (i.e., $z$ is a relative cycle), 
then there is a $w\in C_{n+1}(X)$ with $z-\del w\in C_n^{\Cal U}(X)$ (i.e., $z$ is a relative boundary).
In words, if $z$ has boundary a sum of small simplices, then there is a chain $z^\prime$
made of small simplices so that $z-z^\prime$ is a boundary.

\ssk

And the key to building $z^\prime$ and $w$ is a process known as {\it barycentric subdivision}.
The idea is really the same as for S-vK; we cut our singular simplices up into tiny enough
pieces so that (via the Lebesgue number theorem) 
each piece maps into \u{some} ${\Cal U}_\alpha$ . Unlike S-vK, though, we want to do 
this in a more structured way, so that the cutting up process is ``compatible'' with our
boundary maps. And the best way to describe this cutting up is through {\it barycentric
coordinates}. Recall that an $n$-simplex is the set of convex linar combinations
$\sum x_i v_i$ with $x_i\geq 0$ and $\sum x_i=1$ . The map which sends \u{an}
$n$-simplex to \u{the} $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is literally the map 
$\sum x_i v_i \mapsto (x_0,\ldots ,x_n)$ . These are the barycentric coordinates of an $n$-simplex.
Since, formally, all singular simplices are considered to have $\Delta^n$ for their
domain, we can describe barycentric subdivision by describing how to cut up $\Delta^n$.
The idea is to build a process the is compatible with the boundary map, so that the
subdivision, when restricted to a sub-simplex, is the subdivision of that sub-simplex.
A 1-simplex $[v_0,v_1]$ is subdivided by adding the barycenter $w=(v+0+v_1)/2$ as a vertex,
cutting $[v_0,v_1]$ into two 1-simplices ,$[v_0,w]$,$[w,v_1]$ . A 2-simplex 
$[v_0,v_1,v_2]$ will, to be compatible withe boundary map,
have its boundary cutinto 6 1-simplices; using the barycenter $(v_0+v_1+v_2)/3$
we can cone off each of these 1-simplices to subdivide $[v_0,v_1,v_2]$
into 6 2-simplices. Taking the cue that $2=(1+1)!$ , $6=(2+1)!$ is probably no accident, we
might expect that an $n$-simplex will be cut into $(n+1)!$ $n$-simplices. 
Note that this is thew number of ways of ordering the vertices of our simplex. 
And following the ``pattern'' of our two test cases, where each new simplex was the convex
span of vertices chosen as (vertex) , (barycenter of a 1-simplex having (vertex) as a vertex),
(barycenter of a 2-simplex containing the previous 2 vertices), etc., we are led to the idea that
the barycentric subdivision of an $n$-simplex $[v_0,\ldots , v_n]$ is the 
$(n+1)!$ $n$-simplices, 

\ctln{$[v_{\alpha(0)},(v_{\alpha(0)}+v_{\alpha(1)})/2,(v_{\alpha(0)}+v_{\alpha(1)}+v_{\alpha(2)})/3,\ldots,
(v_{\alpha(0)}+\cdots v_{\alpha(n)})/(n+1)]$}

one for every permutation $\alpha$ of $\{0,\ldots ,n\}$ . And since we want to take into account
\u{orientations} as well, the natural thing to do is to define the barycentric subdivision of a singular
$n$-simplex $\sigma:[v_0,\ldots ,v_n]\ra X$ to be

\ctln{$\displaystyle S(\sigma) = \sum_\alpha {\sgn (\alpha)} \sigma
|_{[v_{\alpha(0)},(v_{\alpha(0)}+v_{\alpha(1)})/2,(v_{\alpha(0)}+v_{\alpha(1)}+v_{\alpha(2)})/3,\ldots,
(v_{\alpha(0)}+\cdots v_{\alpha(n)})/(n+1)]}$}

where the sum is taken over all permutations of $\{0,\ldots ,n\}$ .
This (extending linearly over the chain group) is the subdivision operator, $S:C_n(X)\ra C_n(X)$ . 
A ``routine'' calculation establishes that $\del S = S\del$ , i.e., it is a chain map
(i.e., it behaves well on the boundary of our simplices). The point to this operator is that all of the 
subsimplices in the sum are a definite \u{factor} smaller than the original simplex. In fact,
if the diameter of $[v_0,\ldots ,v_n]$ is $d$ (the largest distance between points, which will,
because it is the convex span of the vertices, be the largest distance between vertices), then
every individual simplex in $S(\sigma)$ will have diameter at most $nd/(n+1)$ (the result of a little
Euclidean geometry and induction). So by \u{repeatedly} applying the subdivision operator
$S$ to a singular simplex, we will obtain a singular chain $S^k(\sigma)$,
which is ``really'' $\sigma$ written as a sum of tiny simplices, whose singular simplices 
have image as small as we want. Or put more succinctly, if $\{{\Cal U}_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $X$
and $\sigma:\Delta^n\ra X$ is a singular $n$-simplex, then choosing a Lebesgue number $\epsilon$ for
the open cover $\sigma^{-1}({\Cal U}_\alpha)$ of the compact metric space $\Delta^n$, and choosing 
a $k$ with $d(n/(n+1))^k<\epsilon$, we find that $S^k(\sigma)$ is a sum of singular simplices
each of which maps into one of the ${\Cal U}_\alpha$, i.e., $S^k(\sigma)\in C_n^{\Cal U}(X)$.

\msk

In the end, we will choose our needed ``small'' cycle to be $z^\prime = S^k z$. and to show that their difference
is a boundary, we will build a chain homotopy between $Id$ and $S^k$.
And to do \u{that}, we define a map $R:C_n(X)\ra C_{n+1}(X\times I)$; when followed by the projection-induced
map $p_\# : C_{n+1}(X\times I)\ra C_{n+1}(X)$, we get a map $T:C_n(X)\ra C_{n+1}(X)$,
and show that $\del T + T\del = I-S$ .
Then we set $H$ = $\sum TS^j$, where the sum is taken over $j=0,\ldots k-1$. Once we define $T$ (!) , we will have
$\del H_k+H_k\del = \sum \del TS^j + TS^j \del = \sum (\del T+T\del) S^j =\sum (S^j-S^{j+1}) = I-S^k$
(since the last sum telescopes). And defining $R$, is, formally, just another particular sum.
Setting up some notation,
thinking of $\Delta^n\times I$ , as before, as having vertices $\{v_0,\ldots v_n\}$ on the 0-end and 
$\{w_0,\ldots ,w_n\}$ on the 1-end,  $N=\{0,\ldots ,n\}$, $\Pi(Q)$ = the group of permutations of $Q$,
and $\sigma^\prime = \sigma\times I:\Delta^n\times I\ra X\times I$), we have

\ssk

$\displaystyle R(\sigma) = 
\sum_{A\subseteq N}\sum_{\pi\in\Pi(N\setminus A)}\big\{ (-1)^{|A|}{\sgn(\pi)}\prod_{j\in N\setminus A}(-1)^j \big\}$

\hfill $\displaystyle  \sigma^\prime
|_{[v_{i_0},\ldots ,v_{i_j},(w_{i_0}+\cdots w_{i_j})/(j+1),
(w_{i_0}+\cdots w_{i_j}+w_{\pi(i_{j+1}})/(j+2),
\ldots ,
(w_{i_0}+\cdots w_{i_j}+w_{\pi(i_{j+1})}+\cdots w_{\pi(i_n)})/(n+1)]}$

\ssk

where we sum over all \u{non-empty} subsets of $\{0,\ldots n\}$ (with the induced ordering on vertices
from the ordering on $\{0,\ldots ,n\}$).
Intuitively, this map ``interpolates'' between the simplex $[v_0,\ldots v_n]$ and the 
barycentric subdivision on $w_0,\ldots ,w_n$, by taking the (signed sums of the) convex spans of
simplices on the bottom (0) and simplices on the top (1). Again, a ``routine'' calculation will 
establish that $\del T + T\del = I-S$ , as desired. [At any rate, I verified it for n=1,2; the formula
for the sign of each simplex was determined by working backwards from these examples.]
