Every
subgroup of a free group is free, because it is the fundamental group of a
covering of a graph, i.e., of a graph.
A subgroup $H$ of index $n$ in $F(\Sigma)$ corresponds to a $n$-sheeted covering $\wtl{X}$ of $X$. If
$|\Sigma| = m$, then $\wtl{X}$ will have $n$ vertices and $nm$ edges. Collapsing a maximal
tree, having $n-1$ edges to a point, leaves a bouquet of $nm-n+1$ circles, so $H\cong F(nm-n+1)$.
For example, for $m=3$, index $n$ subgroups are free on $2n+1$ generators, so every free subgroup
on 4 generators has infinite index in $F(3)$. Try proving that directly!

\msk

{\it Kurosh Subgroup Theorem}: If $H < G_1*G_2$ is a subgroup of
a free product, then $H$ is (isomorphic to) a free product of a
collection of conjugates of subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$ and a 
free froup. The proof is to build a space by taking 2-complexes
$X_1$ and $X_2$ with $\pu$'s isomorphic to $G_1,G_2$ and join
their basepoints by an arc. The covering space of this space $X$
corresponding to $H$ consists of spaces that cover $X_1,X_2$
(giving, after basepoint considerations, the conjugates)
connected by a collection of arcs (which, suitably interpreted,
gives the free group).

\msk

{\it Residually finite groups}: $G$ is said to be residually finite if for every $g\neq 1$ there is a 
finite group $F$ and a homomorphism $\varphi: G\ra F$ with $\varphi(g)\neq 1$ in $F$. This 
amounts to saying that $g\notin$ the (normal) subgroup $\ker(\varphi)$, which amounts to
saying that a loop corresponding to $g$ does \underbar{not} lift to a loop in the finite-sheeted
covering space corresponding to $\ker(\varphi)$. So residual finiteness of a group can be
verified by building coverings of a space $X$ with $\pu(X)=G$. For example, free groups can be
shown to be residually finite in this way. 

\msk

{\it Ranks of free (sub)groups:} A free group on $n$
generators is isomorphic to a free group on $m$ generators
$\lra$ $n=m$; this is because the abelianizations of the two 
groups are ${\Bbb Z}^n,{\Bbb Z}^m$. The (minimal) number of 
generators for a free group is called its {\it rank}.
Given a free group
$G=F(a_1,\ldots a_n)$ and a collection of words $w_1,\ldots w_m\in G$,
we can determine the rank and ndex of the subgroup it $H$ they
generate by building the corresponding cover. The idea is
to start with a bouquet of $m$ circles, each subdivided 
and labelled to spell
out the words $w_i$. Then we repeatedly identify edges sharing
on common vertex if they are labelled precisely the same (same
letter {\it and} same orientation). This process is known
as {\it folding}. One can inductively show that the (obvious)
maps from these graphs to the bouquet of $n$ circles $X_n$ both
have image $H$ under the induced maps on \mpu ; the graphs
are in fact homotopy equivalent, and the map for the unfolded graph
factors through the one for the folded graph. We continue until there
is no more folding to be done; the resulting graph $X$ is what is 
known (in combinatorics) as a {\it graph covering}; the map to $X_n$
is locally injective. If this map is a covering map, then our subgroup
$H$ has finite index (equal to the degree of the
covering) and we can compute the rank of $H$ (and a basis!) from this
index as above. If not, then the map is not locally surjective at
some vertices; if we graft trees onto these vertices, we can extend the map
to an (infinite-sheeted) covering map without changing the homotopy
type of the graph. $H$ therefore has infinite index in $G$, and its
rank can be computed from $H\cong \pu(X)$. An example of this procedure
is given below.

\msk

{\bf Postscript: why care about covering spaces?} The preceding discussion
probably makes it clear that covering places play a central role in
(combinatorial) group theory. It also plays a role in embedding 
problems; a common scenario is to have a map $f:Y\ra X$ which is 
injective on \mpu , and we wish to know if we can lift $f$ to a 
finite-sheeted covering so that the lifted map $\widetilde{f}$ is 
homotopic to an embedding. Information that is easier to obtain 
in the case of an embedding can then be passed down to gain information
abut the original map $f$. And covering spaces underlie the 
theory of analytic continuation in complex analysis; starting
with a domain $D\subseteq {\Bbb C}$, what analytic continuation really
builds is an (analytic) function from a covering space of $D$ to ${\Bbb C}$.
For example, the logarithm is really defined as a map from 
the universal cover of ${\Bbb C}\setminus\{0\}$ to ${\Bbb C}$. 
The various ``branches'' of the logarithm refer to which sheet
in this cover you are in.

{\bf Homology theory:} Fundamental groups are a remarkably powerful
tool for studying spaces; they capture a great deal of the global
structure of a space, and so they are very good a distinguishing
between homotopy-inequivalent spaces. In theory! But in practice,
they suffer from the fact that deciding whether two groups are 
isomorphic or not is, in general, undecideable! Homology theory
is designed to get around this deficiency; the theory, by design,
builds (a sequence of) {\it abelian} groups $H_i(X)$ from a topological
space. And deciding whether or not two \u{abelian} groups, at least
if you're given a presentation for them, is, in the end, a matter of
fairly routine linear algebra. Mostly because of the Fundamental Theorem
of Finitely-generated Abelian groups; each such has a unique representation
as ${\Bbb Z}^m\oplus{\Bbb Z}_{m_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus{\Bbb Z}_{m_n}$
with $m_{i+1}|m_i$ for every $i$ .

\msk

There are also ``higher'' homotopy groups beyond the fundamental group \mpu ,
(hence the name pi-{\it one}); elements are homtopy classes, rel boundary, 
of based maps $(I^n,\del I^n)\ra(X,x_0)$. Multiplication is again by
concatenation. But unlike \mpu , where we have a chance to compute it
via Seifert-van Kampen, nobody, for example knows what all of the 
homotopy groups $\pi_n(S^2$ are (except that nearly all of them are
non-trivial!). Like \mpu, it describes, essentially, maps of $S^n$ into
$X$ which don't extend to maps of $D^{n+1}$, i.e., it turns the ``$n$-dimensional
holes'' of $X$ into a group.

\msk

Homology theory does the exact same thing, counting $n$-dimensional holes.
In the end we will find it to be extremely computable; but it will require
building a fair bit of machinery before it will become so transparent to
calculate. But the short version is that the homology groups compute
``cycles mod boundaries'', that is, $n$-dimesional objects/subsets that
have no boundary (in the appropriate sense) modulo objects that are the
boundary of $(n+1)$-dimensional ones. There are, in fact, probably as many
ways to {\it define} homology groups as there are people actively working
in the field; we will focus on two, simplicial homology and singular homology.
The first is quick to define and compute, but hard to show is an invariant!
The second is quick to see is an invariant, but, on the face of it, hard
to compute! Luckily, for spaces where they are both defined, they are
isomorphic. So, in the end, we get an invariant that is quick to compute.
Of course, so is the invariant ``4''; but this one will be a bit more
informative than that....

\msk

First, simplicial homology. This is a sequence of groups defined for spaces
for which they are easiest to define, which Hatcher calls $\Delta$-complexes.
Basically, they are spaces defined by gluing simplices together using
nice enough maps. More precisely, the {\it standard $n$-simplex} $\Delta^n$ is
the set of points 
$\{(x_1,\ldots x_{n+1})\in{\Bbb R}^{n+1}$ : $\sum x_i=1 , x_i\geq 0$
 for all $i\}$. This can also be expressed as convex linear combinations
(literally, that's the conditions on the $x_i$'s) of the points
$e_i=(0,\ldots ,0,1,0,\ldots ,0)$, the {\it vertices} of the standard
simplex. More generally, an $n$-simplex is the set $[v_0,\ldots v_n]$ of
convex linear combinations of points $v_0,\ldots ,v_n\in{\Bbb R}^{k}$
for which $v_1-v_0,\ldots ,v_n-v_0$ are linearly independent.
Any bijection from the vertices of the standard simplex to the points
$v_0,\ldots ,v_n$ extends (linearly) to a homeomorphism of
the simplices. The $n+1$ {\it faces} of a simplex, each sitting opposite
a vertex $v_i$, are obtained by setting the corresponding coefficient $x_i$ to $0$. 
Each forms an $(n-1)$-simplex, which we denote 
$[v_0,\ldots,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots ,v_n]$ or
$[v_0,\ldots,\widehat{v_{i}},\ldots ,v_n]$ . A {\it $\Delta$-complex} $X$ is a cell
complex obtained by gluing simplices together, but we insist on an extra
condition:
the restriction of the attaching map to any face is equal to a (lower-dimensional)
cell. As before, we use the weak topology on the space; a set is open iff
it's inverse image under the induced map of a cell into the complex is open.
Each $n$-cell comes equipped with a (continuous) map
$\sigma:\Delta^n\ra X$, which is one-to-one on its interior, whose restriction
to the boundary is the attaching map, and whose restriction to each face is the
associated map for that $(n-1)$-simplex. We will typically blur the 
distinction between the map $\sigma$ (called the {\it characteristic map}
of the simplex) and its image, and denote the
image by $\sigma$ (or $\sigma^n$), when this will cause no confusion,
and call $\sigma$ an $n$-simplex {\it in} $X$. When we feel the need for the 
distinction, we will use $e^n$ for the image and $\sigma^n$ for the map.

\ssk

For example, taking our standard,
identifications of the sides of a rectangle, cell structure for the 2-torus,
and cutting the rectangle into two triangles (= 2-simplices) along a diagonal,
we obtain a $\Delta$-structure with 2 2-simplices, 3 1-simplices, and 1 0-simplex.
A genus $g$ surface can be built, by cutting the $2g$-gon into triangles, with
$g+1$ 2-simplices, $3g$ 1-simplices, and 1 0-simplex.

\msk

We typically think of building a $\Delta$-complex $X$ inductively. 
The {\it 0-simplices}
(i.e., points), or {\it vertices}, form the 0-skeleton 
$X^{(0)}$. $n$-simplices $\sigma^n = [v_0,\ldots v_n]$ attach 
to the $(n-1)$-skeleton
to form the $n$-skeleton $X^{(n)}$; the restriction
of the attaching map to each face of $\sigma^n$ is, by definition,
an $(n-1)$-simplex in $X$. The attaching map is (by induction)
really determined by a map $\{v_0,\ldots ,v_n\}\ra X^{(0)}$, since this 
determines the attaching maps for the 1-simplices in the boundary of the
$n$-simplex, which 
gives 1-simplices in $X$, which then give the attaching maps for
the 2-simplices in the boundary, etc. Note that the reverse is not true;
the vertices of two different $n$-simplices in $X$ can be the same.
For example, think of the 2-sphere as a pair of 2-simplices whose 
boundaries are glued by the identity. 

\msk

The final detail that we need before defining (simplicial) homology
groups is the notion of an {\it orientation} on a simplex of $X$.
Each simplex $\sigma^n$ is determined by a map 
$f:\{v_0,\ldots ,v_n\}\ra X^{(0)}$; an orientation on $\sigma^n$ is an
(equivalence class of) the ordered $(n+1)$-tuple $(f(v_0),\ldots f(v_n)) = (V_0,\ldots ,V_n)$.
Another ordering of the
same vertices represents the same orientation if there is an {\it even} permutation
taking the entries of the first $(n+1)$-tuple to the second. This should be thought 
of as a generalization of the right-hand rule for ${\Bbb R}^3$, interpreted as
orienting the vertices of a 3-simplex. Note that there are precisely two
orientations on a simplex.

\msk

Now to define homology! We start by defining $n$-{\it chains};
these are formal linear combinations of the (oriented!) $n$-simplices
of $X$, where $-\sigma$ is interpreted as $\sigma$ with the opposite
(i.e., other) orientation. Adding formal linear combinations formally,
we get the $n$-th {\it chain group} 
$C_n(X) = \{\sum n_\alpha \sigma_\alpha$ : $\sigma_\alpha$ an oriented $n$-simplex in $X\}$ .
We next define a {\it boundary operator} $\del:C_n(X)\ra C_{n-1}(X)$, whose image will be 
the $(n-1)$-chains that are the ``boundaries'' of $n$-chains. We define it on the basis
elements $\sigma_\alpha = \sigma$ of $C_n(X)$ as
$\del\sigma = \sum (-1)^i\sigma|_{[v_0,\ldots,\widehat{v_{i}},\ldots ,v_n]}$ , 
where $\sigma:[v_0,\ldots ,v_n]\ra X$ is the characteristic map of $\sigma_\alpha$ .
We then extend the definition by linearity to all of $C_n(X)$. When a notation indicating
dimension is needed, we write $\del=\del_n$ .
