Invariance of Domain in turn implies the ``other'' invariance of domain; if $f: {\Bbb R}^n\ra {\Bbb R}^m$ is continuous and injective, then
$n\leq m$, since if not, then composition of $f$ with the inclusion $i:{\Bbb R}^m\ra {\Bbb R}^n$, $i(x_1,\ldots ,x_m) = 
(x_1,\ldots ,x_m,0,\ldots ,0)$ is injective and continuous with non-open image (it lies in a hyperplane in ${\Bbb R}^n$),
a contradiction.

\msk

This also gives the more elementary: if ${\Bbb R}^n\cong {\Bbb R}^m$, via $h$, then $n=m$ .
Another proof: by composing with a translation, that $h(0)=0$, and then we have 
$({\Bbb R}^n,{\Bbb R}^n\setminus 0)\cong {\Bbb R}^m,({\Bbb R}^m\setminus 0)$, which gives


\ssk

\ctln{$\widetilde{H}_i(S^{n-1})\cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^n,\del {\Bbb D}^n) \cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^n,{\Bbb D}^n\setminus 0)
\cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb R}^n,{\Bbb R}^n\setminus 0) \cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb R}^m,{\Bbb R}^m\setminus 0)$}

\ctln{$\cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^m,{\Bbb D}^m\setminus 0) \cong H_{i+1}({\Bbb D}^m,\del {\Bbb D}^m)
\cong \widetilde{H}_i(S^{m-1})$}

\ssk

Setting $i=n-1$ gives the result, since $\widetilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{m-1})\cong {\Bbb Z}$ implies $n-1=m-1$ .

{\bf Homology and homotopy groups:} There are connections between homology groups and
the fundamental (and higher) homotopy groups, provided by what is known as the
{\it Hurewicz map} $H:\pi_n(X,x_0)\ra H_n(X)$ . or $n=1$ (higher $n$ are similar)
the idea is that elements of $\pu(X)$ are loops, which can be thought of as maps
$\gamma:S^1\ra X$ (or more precisely, mapping into the path component containing 
$x_0$), inducing a map $\gamma_*:\bbz = H_1(S^1)\ra H_1(X)$ . 
We define $H([\gamma])=\gamma_*(1)$ . Because homotopic maps give the same induced
map on homology, this really is well-defined map on homotopy
classes, i.e. from $\pu(X)$ to $H_1(X)$. [A different view: 
a loop $\gamma:(I,\del I)\ra (X,x_0)$ defines a singular 1-chain which, being a loop,
has zero boundary, so is a 1-cycle. Since based homotopic maps give homologous
chains (essentially by the same homotopy invariance property above), we get a 
well-defined map $\pu(X,x_0)\ra H_1(X)$.

Since as 1-chains, the concatenation $\gamma*\delta$ of two loops is homologous
to the sum $\gamma+\delta$ - the map $K:I\times I\ra X$ given by $K(s,t)=(\gamma*\delta)(s)$,
after crushing the left and right vertical boundaries to points, can be thought of as
a singular 2-simplex with boundary $\gamma + \delta - (\gamma*\delta)$ - the map 
$H$ is a homomorphism.

\msk

When $X$ is path-connected, this map $H:\pu(X)\ra H_1(X)$ is onto . [When it isn't it maps onto the 
summand of $H_1(X)$ corresponding to the path component containing our chosen basepoint.]
To see this, note that any cycle $z\in Z_1(X)$ can be represented as a sum of singular
1-simplices $\sum \sigma_i^1$ , i.e. we can (by reversing the orientations on simplices
to make coefficient positive, and then writing a multiple of a simplex as a sum of
simplices) assume all coefficients in our sum are 1. Then 
$0 = \del z = \sum (\sigma_i^1(0,1) - \sigma_i^1(1,0))$ means that, starting with any positive term, 
we can match it with a 
negative term to cancel that term, which is paired with a postive term, having a matching negative term, etc.,
until the initial positive term is cancelled. This sub-chain represents a collection of paths which 
concatenate to a loop, so $z=$ (this loop) + (the remainiung terms) . Induction implies that
$z$ can be written as a sum of (sums of paths forming loops), which is (as above) homologous  to the
sum of loops. Choosing paths from the start of these loops to our chosen basepoint (which is the only
place where we use path connectedness, we can concatenate the based loops $\overline{\gamma}*\sigma*\gamma$
to a single based loop $\eta$, which under $H$ is sent to a chain homologous to $z$.
So $H[\eta] = [z]$ .

\msk 

Since $H_1(X)$ is abelian (and $\pu(X)$ need not be), the kernel of $H$ contains the
commutator subgroup $[\pu(X),\pu(X)]$ . 
We now show that, if $X$ is path connected,
$H$ induces an isomorphism $H_1(X) \cong \pu(X)/[\pu(X),\pu(X)]$ . 
To show this, it remains to show that  ker$(H)\subseteq [\pu(X),\pu(X)]$ . 
Or put differently, the ineduced map from $\pu(X)_{ab} = \pu(X)/[\pu(X),\pu(X)]$ 
(i.e., $\pu(X)$, written using additive notation) to $H_1(X)$  is injective.
So suppose $[\gamma]\in \pu(X)$ and, thought of as a singular 1-simplex, 
$\gamma = \del w$ for some 2-simplex $w=\sum a_i\sigma_i^2$ . 
As before, we may assume that all $a_i=1$, by reversing orientation and writing multiples as 
sums. By adding ``tails'' from each image of a vertex of each $\sigma_i^2$ to our chosen 
basepoint $x_0$, we may assume that the image of every face of $\Delta^2$, under
the $\sigma_i$ , is a loop at $x_0$ (by essentially replacing each $\sigma_i$ with a $\tau_i$
which first collapses little triangle at each vertex to arcs, maps the resulting central triangle
via $\sigma_i$, and the arcs via the paths). 

\ssk

Once we have made this slight alteration, the equation
$\displaystyle \gamma = \del w = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=0}^2 \del_j \sigma_i = 0$
makes sense (and is true) in both ($C_1(X)$ hence $Z_1(X)$ hence) $H_1(X)$ and
$\pu(X)_{ab}$, the first essentially by definition and the second because 
all of the $\del_j \sigma_i$ are loops at $x_0$ and, in 
$\pu(X)$, $(\del_0\sigma_i)\overline{\del_1\sigma_i}(\del_2\sigma_i)$ is null-homotopic,
so is trivial in $\pu(X)$. Written additively, this means that in
$\pu(X)_{ab}$ , $\del_0\sigma_i - \del_1\sigma_i + \del_2\sigma_i = 0$. 
So $\gamma = 0$ in $\pu(X)_{ab}$ , as desired.

\msk

This result can be used both ways; knowing a (presentation for) $\pu(X)$
allows us to compute $H_1(X)$, by writing the relators additively, giving
$H_1(X)$ as the free abelian group on the generators, modulo the kernel 
of the ``presentation matrix'' given by the resulting linear equations. Conversely,
knowing $H_1(X)$ provides information about $\pu(X)$. For example,
a calculation on the way to invariance of domain implied that for every
knot $K$ in $S^3$ (i.e., the image of an embedding $h:S^1\hookrightarrow S^3$),
$H_1(S^3\setminus K) \cong bbz$ . This implies that the abelianization of 
$G_K = \pu(S^3\setminus K)$ (i.e., the largest abelian quotient of $G_K$  is $\bbz$.
But this in turn implies that for every integer $n\geq 2$, there is a \u{unique}
surjective homomorphism $G_K\ra \bbz_n$, since such a homomorphism must factor 
through the abelianization, and there is exactly one surjective homomorphism
$\bbz \ra \bbz_n$ ! Consequently, there is a unique (normal) subroup (the kernel
of this homomorphism) $K_n\sset G_K$ with quotient $\bbz_n$ . Using the Galois
correspondence, there is a (unique) covering space $X_n$ of $X=S^3\setminus K$
corresponding to $K_n$, called the $n$-fold cyclic covering of $K$ . This space is determined
by $K$ and $n$, and so its homology groups are determined by the same data.
And even though homology cannot distinguish between two knot complements,
$K$, $K^\prime$, it might be the case that homology \u{can} distinguish between 
their cyclic coverings. Consequently, 
if $H_1(X_n)\not\cong H_1(X_n^\prime)$, then $K$ and $K^\prime$ have non-homeomorphic
complement, and so represent ``different'' embeddings, hence different knots.
In practice, one can compute presentations for $\pu(X_n)$ (in several different ways),
and so one can compute $H_1(X_n)$, providing an effective way to use homology
to distinguish knots! This approach was ultimately formalized (by Alexander) into a polynomial
invariant of knots, known as the Alexander polynomial.

A map of pairs $f: (X,A) \ra (Y,B)$ (meaning that $f(A)\subseteq B$)
induces (by postcomposition) a map of relative homology $f_*:H_i(X,A)\ra H_i(Y,B)$ , just as with 
absolute homology.
We also get a homotopy-invariance result: if $f,g: (X,A) \ra (Y,B)$ are maps of pairs
which are {\it homotopic as maps of pairs},
i.e., there is a map $(X\times I,A\times I)\ra (Y,B)$ which is $f$ on one end and $g$
on the other, then $f_*=g_*$ . The proof is identical to the one given before; the prism map 
$P$ sends chains in $A$ to chains in $A$, so induces a map $C_i(X\times I,A\times I)\ra C_{i+1}(X,A)$
which does precisely what we want.
