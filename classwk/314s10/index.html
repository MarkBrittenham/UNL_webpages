<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 314 classes
for Spring, 2010. 
Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.html">homework assignments</a>, 
dates for <a href="exam.html">exams</a>, 
the course summary as <a href="fd.ps">Postscript</a> and <a href="fd.pdf">PDF</a>, and anything else that
might come up.

A <a href="http://pax.st.usm.edu/~kolibal/kolibal_html/mat326_html/linal.html">
general page</a> of links to linear algebra resources includes a set of
<a href="http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~msapir/M314HNotes/frame.html">WebNotes</a>
by a former UNL professor, which in turn points to a web-based
<a href="http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/cgi-bin/mapleFE.pl">Maple V front-end</a>.
(The only problem with the front-end is that it has no help file, so you need to 
memorize the appropriate 
commands in order to use it.)

Some <a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~tshores1/mylinalg.html">linear algebra resources</a>
maintained by Tom Shores at UNL.
<p>


Some <a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~tshores1/Public/MapleFiles/LinearAlgebra/">Maple stuff</a> would probably be useful. Here's some code I found
lying around my computer account.
As an example, you can cut and paste this stuff in:

<p>

with(linalg); <br>
A:=matrix([[.1,.3,.7],[.4,.3,.1],[.5,.4,.2]]); <br>
v:=matrix(3,1,[.2,.3,.5]); <br>
w:=matrix(3,1,[.9,0,.1]); <br>
evalm(A^20*v); <br>
evalm(A^20*w);
<p>
(These are examples of Markov chains. If you want to have some fun, change
the 20's to 20000's.... note the amount of time (at the bottom) each takes...)

<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/sosmath/">SOS Math</a> at the Univ. of 
Texas at El Paso offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://home.scarlet.be/~ping1339/index.html">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

<a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/">Dan Sloughter</a> has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.netsrq.com/~hahn/calculus.html">Karl's Calculus Tutor</a> 
currently covers most of what would qualify as first-semester calculus, and some of the
second semester, as well.<p>

Forget a geometry formula? Check <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~mcenter/geometry.html">
this page</a> at Trinity College.<p>

A Java-enabled page for generating <a href="http://frankenstein.worldweb.net/donovan/cv/">
Pascal's triangle</a> (or rather, the last two digits of each entry, which is good enough
through the 24th line). What's the pattern of the even numbers in the triangle?!<p>
