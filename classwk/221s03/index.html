<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 221 class
for Spring, 2003. Here you may find lists of <a href="hw.html">homework assignments</a>, 
dates for <a href="exam.html">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams,
an html-ized copy of the <a href="221fd.html">course summary</a> 
(as well as <a href="221fd.ps">Postscript</a> and <a href="221fd.pdf">PDF</a>), and anything else that
might come up.</center>

A web-based
<a href="http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/cgi-bin/mapleFE.pl">Maple V front-end</a>.
(The only problem with the front-end is that it has no help file, so you need to 
memorize the appropriate 
commands in order to use it.) As an example, you can cut and paste this stuff in:<p>

dsolve(diff(y(t),t)-y(t)^2,[y(t)]);<p>

it will solve the differential equation  [dy/dt] - y<sup>2</sup> = 0 .<br>
(Apparently, there are slight differences in how versions 4 and 5 handle "dsolve";
see the page below.)
<p>
You can find more examples of Maple code on <a href="maple.html">this page</a>.
Unfortunately, this front-end apparently stinks on returning graphical output,
so the examples of direction fields on that page don't work very well. You'll
have to cut and paste them into a real copy of MapleV.<p>

<center><b>Some (mathematical) links that might be of general interest:</b></center>
<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/sosmath/">SOS Math</a> at the Univ. of 
Texas at El Paso offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://www.ping.be/~ping1339/hp.htm">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

<a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/">Dan Sloughter</a> has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.netsrq.com/~hahn/calculus.html">Karl's Calculus Tutor</a> 
currently covers most of what would qualify as first-semester calculus, and some of the
second semester, as well.<p>

Forget a geometry formula? Check <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~mcenter/geometry.html">
this page</a> at Trinity College.<p>

A Java-enabled page for generating <a href="http://frankenstein.worldweb.net/donovan/cv/">
Pascal's triangle</a> (or rather, the last two digits of each entry, which is good enough
through the 24th line). What's the pattern of the even numbers in the triangle?!<p>
