problems assigned, dates for exams, etc.)

<b>Office Hours:</b> (tentatively) Mo 11:00-12:00, Tu 2:00 - 3:00, We 1:00-2:00, 
and Th 11:00 - 12:00, and whenever you can find me in my office and I'm not 
horrendously busy. You are also quite welcome to make an appointment
for any other time; this is easiest to arrange just before or 
after class.

<b>Text:</b> <i>Calculus</i>, 
by Smith and Minton (McGraw-Hill, 2nd edition).
<p>
<p><br>
This course, as the name is meant to imply, is a continuation of Calculus 
1. We will pick things up slightly before where that course left off, and 
essentially work our way through the second third of the text. In particular, we will cover 
the following chapters of the book (although not necessarily in this order):
<p>
<p>
Ch. 4, Integration
<p>
Ch. 5, Applications of the Definite Integral
<p>
Ch. 6, Exponentials, Logarithms, and Other Transcendental Functions
<p>
Ch. 7, Integration Techniques
<p>
Ch, 8, Infinite Series
<p>
Ch, 9, Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates
<p>
<p><br>
<b>Homework</b> will be assigned from each section, as we finish it. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics, we learn best by doing (again and again and ...). Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you should make sure you are understanding the
process of finding the solution, on your own - after 
all, you get to bring only one brain to exams (and it can't be someone 
else's). For the same reason, I also recommend that you try working 
each problem on your own, first. Some portion of the homework will 
be collected and graded; it will count 60 points toward your final grade
<p>
<p>
<b>Quizzes</b> will typically be held each Friday, at the end of class, unless 
that week includes an exam (in <i>our</i> class...). They will cover 
material presented in class through the previous Wednesday. Your lowest two 
quiz grades will be dropped before computing your quiz score, which will count 
100 points toward your grade. A missed quiz will count as zero (and will therefore 
be the first grade dropped); a make-up quiz can be arranged only under the most 
unusual of circumstances.
<p>
<p>
<b>Midterm exams</b> will be given three times during the 
semester, in the evenings, from 7pm to 9pm. Specific dates
will be worked out at the beginning of the semester. 
Each exam will count 100 points toward your final grade. You can take a 
make-up exam only if there are compelling reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you to miss an exam. Make-up 
exams may be harder than the originals (because make-up exams 
are harder to write!). 
<p>
<p>
Finally, there will be a regularly scheduled <b>final exam</b>, on 
Monday, December 15, from 7:30am to 9:30am. 
It will cover the entire course, with a slight emphasis 
on material covered after the last midterm exam. It will count 
140 points toward your grade.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>Your course grade</b> will be based upon this total of
60+ 100 + 3&times;100 + 140 = 600 points,
and will be converted to a letter grade, taking into account 
the overall average of the class. However, a score of 90% or 
better will guarantee some kind of <b>A</b>, 80% or better at 
least some sort of <b>B</b>, 70% or better at least a flavor of 
<b>C</b>, and 60% or better at least a <b>D</b>.
<p>
<p><br><p><br>
In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. (In particular, a proper mastery of the material 
from Calculus I is central to making your Calculus II experience bearable. The time
to start reviewing that material is now!) 
Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make 
<U>sure</U> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's 
<U>your</U> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, and to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's alot easier to read 50 pages of the text in a week 
than it is in a day. Try to do some mathematics every single day.
<b>Class attendance</b> is probably your best way to insure that you will keep 
up with the material, and make sure that you understand all of the
concepts. And in the end it's not what the book says,
but what the <i>instructor</i> says, that is usually the most important to learn. 
(Books don't write exams.) This makes it doubly important to attend class.

<b>Math Resource Center:</b> Students in Math 107 are encouraged to use 
the Mathematics Resource Center (MRC) in Burnett 106 as a 
source of additional assistance on questions related to this course. 
The hours for the MRC are 12:30-8:30 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday, 12:30-2:30 p.m. Friday and 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. Sunday.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>Departmental Grading Appeals Policy:</b> Students who believe their
academic evaluation has been prejudiced or capricious have recourse for appeals 
to (in order) the instructor, the departmental chair, the departmental appeals 
committee, and the college appeals committee.
