<b>Text:</b> <i>A Mathematical View of the World</i>, by Parks, Musser, Trimpe, Maurer, and Maurer (2007).

<p>
This course, as the name is meant to imply, is intended to give us a chance to 
look at some of the problems, methods, and results of contemporary mathematical thinking.
Our goal is not so much to learn specific mathematical skills, as it is in most other 
mathematics courses;
our interest is more to see how mathematics fits into the modern world, to develop
problem solving skills, and to develop communications skills, especially in communicating
mathematical ideas.

<p>
Our basic goal will be to work through the following chapters:

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 1, Numbers in Our Lives

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 2, Shapes in Our Lives

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 6, Routes and Networks

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 7, Scheduling

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 8, Descriptive Statistics - Data and Patterns

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 9, Collecting and Interpreting Data

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 10, Probability

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 11, Inferential Statistics

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 3, Voting and Elections

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 4, Fair Division

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 5, Apportionment

<p>
<b>Quizzes</b> will be given in class as we finish each chapter; 
each will be between 15 and 30 minutes long. In accordance with the university's 
dead week policy, a quiz for the last chapter we cover cannot
be given during the last week of classes, and will therefore be given 
during the regularly-scheduled
final exam time, Thursday, Dec. 20, from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.
Your quiz grades will constitute 60% of your final grade.

<p>
You can take a make-up quiz only if there are compelling reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you to miss a quiz. Make-up 
quizzes tend to be harder than the originals (because make-up quizzes
are harder to write!). 

<p>
<b>Homework</b> will be assigned nearly every day. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics (and a lot else), we learn best by doing. Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you should try working through problems first on your 
own - after all, you get to use only one brain on quizzes (and it 
can't be someone else's). 

<p>
Between one and three problems will be collected at the beginning of 
the next class and graded.
Together the homework assignments will constitute 10% of your final grade.

<p>
<b>Writing assignments</b> are an integral part of this class, since this course
may be used to meet the Integrated Studies requirement. At regular intervals, three
or four times during the semester, you will you will essentially carry out an analysis 
of a mathematical problem using the tools introduced in class, or explore a topic
related to the ideas explored in class, or write about some other mathematically
inclined topic, and write a report of your findings. These
reports will be graded both on their mathematical content and their grammatical 
accuracy. Together they will constitute the remaining 30% of your grade.

<p>
<br /><b>Your course grade</b> will be calculated numerically using the above components,
and will be converted to a letter grade based partly on the overall average of the
class. However, an overall score of 90% or better will guarantee some kind of <b>A</b>, 80%
or better at least some sort of <b>B</b>, 70% or better at least a flavor of <b>C</b>, and 60% or 
better at least a <b>D</b>.

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Calculators:</b> You will need a small calculator, with a square root function, for 
portions of this course. You will be allowed to use a calculator during the quizzes. 
However, a cell phone calculator cannot be used on quizzes.

<p>
<b>Cell phones</b> should be silenced for the duration of all classes, and <u>extreme</u>
restraint should be exercised in answering a call during class. If you feel that you must 
answer a call, please excuse yourself from the room before beginning to take the call.

<p>
<br />In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make <u>sure</u> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's <u>your</u> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, and to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's alot easier to read 50 pages in a week than it is
in a day. The best strategy is probably to try to do some work for the class 
every single day.
