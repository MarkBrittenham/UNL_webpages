<b>Office Hours:</b> (tentatively) Mo 11:00-12:00, Tu 2:00 - 3:00, We 1:00-2:00, 
and Th 1:00 - 2:00, and whenever you can find me in my office and I'm not 
horrendously busy. You are also quite welcome to make an appointment
for any other time; this is easiest to arrange just before or 
after class.

<b>Text:</b> <i>Calculus: Single and Multivariable</i>, 
by Hughs-Hallett, Gleason, and McCallum (Wiley, 2nd edition).
<p>
<p><br>
This course, as the name is meant to imply, is a continuation of Calculus 
1 and 2. Our goal is to redo much of what was covered in the previous courses, 
for functions having <i>several</i> variables (whatever they are).
Our basic goal will be to work through the remaining chapters of the book; :
<p>
<p>
Ch. 11, Functions of Many Variables
<p>
Ch. 12, A Fundamental Tool: Vectors
<p>
Ch. 13, Differentiating Functions of Many Variables
<p>
Ch. 14, Optimization
<p>
Ch, 15, Integrating Functions of Many Variables
<p>
Ch, 16, Paramentric Curves
<p>
Ch, 17, Vector Fields
<p>
Ch, 18, Line Integrals
<p>
Ch, 19, Flux Integrals
<p>
Ch, 20, Calculus of Vector Fields
<p>
<p>
This might <i>sound</i> like alot of material, and in some sense it is, 
but you should also note that three of the chapters have only two sections
(and for two of them, we are only scheduled to cover one section).
<p>
<p><br>
<b>Homework</b> will be assigned from each section, as we finish it. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics, we learn best by doing (again and again and ...). Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you should make sure you are understanding the
process of finding the solution, on your own - after 
all, you get to bring only one brain to exams (and it can't be someone 
else's). For the same reason, I also recommend that you try working 
each problem on your own, first. Homework will not be collected (and therefore, not 
graded); but it is probably the most important way to make sure that you are 
understanding the material.
<p>
<p>
In addition, we will have one significantly larger assignment. This <b>project</b>
will be assigned at the begining of November, and will be collected several weeks later. 
You may choose to work on the project in groups of up to three, with one write-up
turned in for the group, or you may choose to work on it individually. It will 
count 40 points towards your final grade.
<p>
<p>
<b>Quizzes</b> will be held (usually) each Friday, at the end of class, unless 
that week 
includes an exam (in <i>our</i> class...). They will (usually) cover material 
presented in class through
the previous Monday. Your lowest two quiz grades will be dropped before computing your
final average, which will provide 100 points toward your grade. A missed quiz will 
count as zero (and will therefore be the first grade dropped); a make-up quiz can 
be arranged only under the most unusual of circumstances.
<p>
<p>
<b>Midterm exams</b> will be given three times during the 
semester, approximately every four weeks - the specific dates will 
be announced in class well in advance (likely candidates: late September, 
end of October, early December). Each exam will count 100 points toward your grade. 
You can take a 
make-up exam only if there are compelling reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you to miss an exam. Make-up 
exams tend to be harder than the originals (because make-up exams 
are harder to write!). 
<p>
<p>
Finally, there will be a regularly scheduled <b>final exam</b>, which will be
common to all sections of this course, and will be given on 
Tuesday, December 13, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. Note that this <i>differs</i> from 
the exam time scheduled for the course, based on its meeting time.
It will cover the entire course, (probably) with a slight emphasis 
on material covered after the last midterm exam. It will count 
160 points toward your grade.
<p>
<p><br>
<b>Your course grade</b> will therefore be calculated based upon a total of
40+100+3&times;100+160 = 600 points,
and will be converted to a letter grade based partly on the overall average of the
class. However, a score of 90% or better will guarantee some kind of <b>A</b>, 80%
or better at least some sort of <b>B</b>, 70% or better at least a flavor of 
<b>C</b>, and 60% or 
better at least a <b>D</b>.
<p>
<p>
A proper mastery of the material from Calculus I and II is essential, in 
order to make your Calculus III experience bearable. The department will therefore 
administer a web-based <b>preparedness exam</b> at the beginning of 
the semester. You may take the exam as many times as you like; a score
of 7 out of 10 will be considered a passing grade. Passing the exam by
Wednesday, Sept. 8 will give you 10 <b>extra credit</b> points toward your 
final grade; passing by Friday, Sept. 17 will give you 5 points. More details on
how the exam will be administered will be provided soon.
<p>
<p><br><p><br>
In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make 
<U>sure</U> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's 
<U>your</U> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, and to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's alot easier to read 50 pages in a week than it is
in a day. Try to do some mathematics every single day. (I do.)
<b>Class attendance</b> is probably your best way to insure that you will keep 
up with the material, and make sure that you understand all of the
concepts. I will not be taking attendance; I expect that you will simply 
see the wisdom of attending class, for yourselves.

<b>Departmental Grading Appeals Policy:</b> Students who believe their
academic evaluation has been prejudiced or capricious have recourse for appeals 
to (in order) the instructor, the departmental chair, the departmental appeals 
committee, and the college appeals committee.
<p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> If this is your first college mathematics course, then you may 
be eligible for 10 hours of credit for Math 106 and 107, provided you get a 
grade of C, P, or better in Math 208 this semester. To be considered for this
benefit, you should register with the Department of Mathematics, 810 Oldfather 
Hall, by <b>Wednesday, Sept. 8, 1999</b>.
