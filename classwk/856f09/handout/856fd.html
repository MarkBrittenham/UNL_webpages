<b>Text:</b> <i>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</i>, 
by John M. Lee (1st edition, Springer Verlag).

<p>
<br />This course, as its name is meant to imply, is intended to introduce you to 
the theory, techniques, and applications of smooth manifolds; broadly speaking,
this subject is known as differential 
topology. In basic outline we will follow the text; the specific topics covered
will depend partly on student interest. 

<p>
<br /><b>Homework</b> will be assigned approximately every one to two weeks, and collected
one week after it is assigned. Somewhat more problems will be assigned than are collected;
those to be collected will be announced when the problems are assigned. The problems 
collected will be graded and returned. These grades will form the (only) basis 
for your final course grade. There will be no midterm or final exam in this class.

<p>
<br /><b>Departmental Grading Appeals Policy:</b> Students who believe their
academic evaluation has been prejudiced or capricious have recourse for appeals 
to (in order) the instructor, the departmental chair, the departmental appeals 
committee, and 
the college appeals committee.
