\ctln{Starred (*) problems to be handed in Friday, September 11}

\bsk

\nidt {\bf (*) 1:} Show that a connected manifold $M$ is {\it arcwise connected},
that is, for every pair of points $x,y\in M$ there is a
{\it one-to-one} path $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow M$ with $\gamma(0)=x,\gamma(1)=y$.

(There is a theorem, due to Hahn and Mazurkiewicz (circa 1914), which says 
that a Hausdorff space is path connected iff it is
arcwise connected (which is kind of funny, since the term ``Hausdorff''
wasn't really introduced until the 1920s?); but for manifolds you can 
give a much more elementary proof...)

\msk

\nidt{\bf 2:} Show that if $A,B\subseteq {\Bbb R}^2$ are closed subsets, the statement

\ctln{`` ${\Bbb R}^2\setminus A \cong {\Bbb R}^2\setminus B$ $\Rightarrow$
$A \cong B$ ''}

\hfill is {\bf false}. What about the converse statement?

\msk

\nidt{\bf 3} Show that every topological $n$-manifold has a countable basis consisting of
open sets homeomorphic to $\bbr^n$. [Hint: start with any old countable basis....]

\msk

\nidt {\bf (*) 4:} (Lee, p. 28, problem 1-4) If $0\leq k\leq \min\{m,n\}$, show that the set 
$R_k\subseteq M(m\times n,{\Bbb R})$ of $m$-by-$n$ matrices 
with rank $\geq k$ is an open subset of $M(m\times n,{\Bbb R})
\cong {\Bbb R}^{mn}$ (and therefore admits a smooth structure).
({\it Hint:} look at Lee's linear algebra appendix...)

\msk

\nidt {\bf (*) 5.:} We say that two charts 
$\phi :U\rightarrow {\Bbb R}^n$ , $\psi :V\rightarrow {\Bbb R}^n$,
$U,V\subseteq M^n$ are \underbar{$C^\infty$-related}
if $\psi\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi(U\cap V)\rightarrow \psi(U\cap V)$
and $\phi\circ\psi^{-1}:\psi(U\cap V)\rightarrow \phi(U\cap V)$
are both $C^\infty$. Show that the relation `` is $C^\infty$-related
to '' is {\bf not} an equivalence relation.
(Hint: $M^n = {\Bbb R}$ will suffice for an example...)

\msk

\nidt {\bf 6:} Show that ${\Bbb R}$ has uncountably many distinct smooth structures.
((Perhaps) show first that it is enough to find uncountably many charts, with intersecting domains 
and ranges, no two of which are $C^\infty$-related to one another.)
