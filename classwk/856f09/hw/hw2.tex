\ctln{Target date for starred {\bf (*)} problems to be handed in: Friday, September 25}

\nidt {\bf (*) 7:} [Lee, problem 2-1 (part)] Using the charts on the circle $S^1$ given 
by steriographic projection, compute the local coordinate representations of the functions

\ssk

\ctln{$f_n:S^1\rightarrow S^1$ given by $f_n(z)=z^n$ (in complex coordinates)}

\ssk

and use this to demonstrate that each $f_n$ is $C^\infty$.

\msk

\nidt {\bf (*) 8:} Show that a function $f:M^n\rightarrow N^m$ is $C^\infty$ $\Leftrightarrow$ 
$g\circ f:M^n\rightarrow {\Bbb R}$ is $C^\infty$ for {\it every} $C^\infty$ function
$g:N^m\rightarrow {\Bbb R}$. (Hint: you might need to use the technology of bump functions
to do this?)

\msk

\nidt {\bf 9:} Let ${\Bbb H}^n=\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\bbr^n : x_n\geq 0\}$. Suppose that 
$f:{\Bbb H}^n\rightarrow \bbr$ is a function for which every $x\in {\Bbb H}^n$ has an open 
neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $f$ extends to a $C^\infty$ function on $U_x$. Show that $f$ extends
to a $C^\infty$ function on a neighborhood of ${\Bbb H}^n$ in $\bbr^n$. 
(Short version: show that if $f$ is locally smooth, then $f$ is smooth. A well-chosen partition
of unity might help?)

\msk

\nidt {\bf 10:} We know that if $C,D\subseteq M$ are disjoint closed sets of the smooth manifold $M$,
then there exists a smooth function $f:M\ra [0,1]$ with $C\subseteq f^{-1}(0)$ and $D\subseteq f^{-1}(1)$.
But we can in fact make these containments {\it equalities}:

\ssk

(a) Show that it suffices to build a smooth function $g:M\ra [0,1]$ with $C=g^{-1}(0)$.

\ssk

(b) Build a countable cover $\{U_i\}$ of $M\setminus C$ by open sets of the form $h_i^{-1}(B(x_i,1)$ for
a collection of coordinate charts $h_i=(x^1,\ldots,x^n)$ with image containing $B(x_i,2)$. Build $C^\infty$ functions $g_i:M\ra \bbr$ which are $>0$
in $U_i$ and $=0$ on $M\setminus U_i$. Note that $\overline{U_i}$ is compact; for each $i$, let

\ssk

\ctln{$\displaystyle \alpha_i = \sup_{x\in \overline{U_i};j\leq i;m\leq i;k_1,\ldots 
k_m\leq n}\{ {{\del^m g_j}\over{\del x^{k_1}\cdots \del x^{k_m}}}(x)\}$ .}

\ssk

\noindent Show that the function $g=\sum g_i/(\alpha_i 2^i)$ is $C^\infty$ and $C=g^{-1}(0)$ .

\msk

\nidt {\bf 11:} [Lee, problem 2-6] For $M$ a (smooth) manifold, let $C(M)$ denote the
set of continuous functions from $M$ to $\bbr$, thought of as an algebra (i.e., a ring and a vector
space over $\bbr$) with scalar multiplication by $\bbr$, and pointwise addition and multiplication.
Let $C^\infty(M)$ be the subalgebra of smooth functions. If $F:M\ra N$ is continuous,
let $F^*:C(N)\ra C(M)$ be given by $F^*(f)=f\circ F$.

\ssk

(a) Show that $F^*$ is a linear map.

\ssk

(b) Show that $F$ is smooth \lra\ $F^*(C^\infty(N))\subseteq C^\infty(M)$ .

\ssk

(c) Suppose $F$ is a homeomorphism. Show that $F$ is a diffeomorphism

\noindent \lra\ $F^*:C^\infty(N)\ra C^\infty(M)$ is an isomorphism.

\msk

\nidt {\bf (*) 12:} [Lee, problem 2-17] Find an example of a (non-closed: it can't be done if the set is
closed!) subset $A$ of a smooth manifold $M$, and a smooth function $f:A\rightarrow \bbr$ which admits
{\bf no} extension to a smooth function $\tilde{f}:M\rightarrow \bbr$.

\ssk

(Note that $f$ is called smooth if for every $x\in A$ there is a neighborhood $x\in{\Cal U}$ and a smooth
extension of $f|_{A\cap {\Cal U}}$ to the neighborhood ${\Cal U}$.
