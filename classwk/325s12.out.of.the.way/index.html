<center>This page is devoted to materials and links specific to Mark Brittenham's Math 325 class
for Spring, 2012. Here you can find copies of the
<a href="hw">homework assignments</a>, 
review materials for <a href="exam">exams</a>, as well as lists of topics covered by these exams. 
You can download a copy of the course summary, in 
<a href="325policysheet.ps">Postscript</a> or <a href="325policysheet.pdf">PDF</a> format.</center>

<p>
Materials that are not for public consumption (read: exercise solutions) will be 
placed in the class <a href="lockbox">lockbox</a>; username and password are
available from the instructor.
<p>

Since our work will be related to material from the first three semesters of 
calculus, I have dug up the <a href="review">review sheets</a> that I handed 
out, from the last times I 
taught each of those courses, and placed them in a directory for your review.

<center><b>Some (mathematical) links that might be of general interest:</b></center>
<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.sosmath.com/">SOS Math</a> 
offers pages of material on topics ranging from polynomial long 
division, the quadratic formula, and trigonometric identities, to Taylor polynomials, 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Matrix algebra.<br>

<a href="http://home.scarlet.be/~ping1339/index.html">Another site</a> covering similar material,
including solved homework problems for you to practice on, is kept in Belgium.<p>

Dan Sloughter has a web page containing
Java programs for visualizing various mathematical concepts. My favorite is one which will
draw the <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/java/taylor.html">Taylor polynomial approximations</a>
for y=sin(x) .<p>

A site called <a href="http://www.karlscalculus.org/">Karl's Calculus Tutor</a> 
currently covers most of what would qualify as first-semester calculus, and some of the
second semester, as well.<p>
