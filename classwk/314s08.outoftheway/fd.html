lists of homework problems assigned, dates for exams, etc.)

<p>
<b>Office Hours:</b> (tentatively) 
Tu 9:30 - 10:30, We 11:00-12:00, 
and Th 2:30 - 3:30, and whenever you can find me in my office and I'm not 
horrendously busy. You are also welcome to make an appointment
for any other time; this is easiest to arrange just before or 
after class.

<b>Text:</b> <i>Linear Algebra: a Modern Introduction</i>, 
by David Poole (2nd edition, Brooks/Cole).

<p>
<br />This course, as the text and course titles are meant to imply, 
is intended to illustrate the 
theory, techniques, and applications of linear algebra (i.e., solutions to linear 
equations) through
the use of matrices (whatever they are).
Our basic goal will be to work through most of each chapter of the book:

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 1, Vectors

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 2, Systems of Linear Equations

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 3, Matrices

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 4, Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch. 5, Orthogonality

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch, 6, Vector Spaces

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch, 7, Distance and Approximation

<p>
<br /><b>Homework</b> will be assigned from each section, as we finish it. 
It is an essential ingredient to the course - as with almost all of 
mathematics, we learn best by doing (again and again and ...). Cooperation 
with other students on these assignments is acceptable, and even 
encouraged. However, you should make sure you are understanding the
process of finding the solution, on your own - after 
all, you get to bring only one brain to exams (and it can't be someone 
else's). For the same reason, I also recommend that you try working 
each problem on your own, first. Homework will not be collected, 
and therefore, not 
graded (the solution to every odd-numbered problem may be found at the 
end of the book); but it is probably the most important ingredient toward making
sure that you are understanding the material.

<p>
In addition, we will have a significantly larger 
assignment. This <b>project</b>
will probably be assigned near the end of February, and 
be due several weeks later. 
You may choose to work on the project in groups of 
up to three, with one write-up
turned in for the group, or you may choose to work 
on it individually. It will require the use of a computer algebra
system for its solution. The Math Department Computer Lab 
(Avery 18) is available for this purpose, for
all students enrolled in the course. To obtain a computer account, 
students must attend a lab orientation session.
The schedule for orientation sessions will be announced in 
class near the beginning of the semester.

<p>
The project will count 10% towards your final grade.

<p>
<br /><b>Quizzes</b> will be given each Thursday, 
during weeks that do not 
also contain 
an exam (in <i>our</i> class...) or the first 
day of classes. Each will 
typically consist of one
question (modelled on a homework problem) from 
the material covered through
the previous Tuesday. Your lowest two quiz grades 
will be dropped before computing your
final quiz average, which will constitute 20 % of 
your grade. A missed quiz will 
count as zero (and will therefore be the first 
grade dropped); a make-up quiz can 
be arranged only under the most unusual of circumstances.

<p>
<br /><b>Midterm exams</b> will be given two times during the 
semester, <b>in the evening, outside of normal 
class time</b>, approximately every six weeks - 
the specific dates will 
be announced in class well in advance 
(likely candidates: late February, 
early April). Each exam will count 
20% toward your grade. You can take a 
make-up exam only if there are compelling 
reasons (a doctor SAYS 
you were sick, jury duty, etc.) for you 
to miss an exam. Make-up 
exams tend to be harder than the originals 
(because make-up exams 
are harder to write!). 

<p>
<br />Finally, there will be a regularly scheduled <b>final exam</b> on 
Tuesday, May 6, from 3:30pm to 5:30pm.
It will cover the entire course, with a slight emphasis 
on material covered after the last midterm exam. It will count the 
remaining 30% toward your grade. You
must arrange your personal and work schedules to 
allow you to take the exam at this scheduled time.

<p>
<br /><b>Your course grade</b> will be calculated numerically using the above scales,
and will be converted to a letter grade based partly on the overall average of the
class. However, a score of 90% or better will guarantee some kind of <b>A</b>, 80%
or better at least some sort of <b>B</b>, 70% or better at least a flavor of 
<b>C</b>, and 60% or 
better at least a <b>D</b>.

<p>
<br /><br />In mathematics, new concepts continually rely upon the mastery
of old ones; it is therefore essential that you thoroughly understand each 
new topic before moving on. Our classes are an important opportunity for you to ask
questions; to make <u>sure</u> that you are understanding concepts correctly.
Speak up! It's <u>your</u> education at stake. Make every effort to resist
the temptation to put off work, and to fall behind. Every topic has to be gotten 
through, not around. And it's a lot easier to read 50 pages in a week than it is
in a day. Try to do some mathematics every single day.
<b>Class attendance</b> and <b>doing the homework</b> are your best 
methods for insuring that you will keep 
up with the material, and to make sure that you understand all of the
concepts. 

<p>
<br /><b>Departmental Grading Appeals Policy:</b> The Department of 
Mathematics does not tolerate discrimination  
or harassment on the basis of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. 
If you believe you have been subject to such discrimination or harassment,  
in this or any other math course, please contact the department. 
If, for this or any other reason, you believe your grade was assigned 
incorrectly or capriciously, then appeals may be made (in order)  to 
the instructor, the department chair, the department grading appeals  
committee, the college grading appeals committee, and the university  
grading appeals committee.
