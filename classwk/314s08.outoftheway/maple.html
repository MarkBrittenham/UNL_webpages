The math department claims to keep a collection of
<a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/Dept/Resources/CourseMaterial/M314/">resources</a>,
including Maple worksheets
(as Maple files are called) that you can experiment with. But the pages are mostly
empty. As we go along in the semester I will try to build a library of worksheets
for us. In the meantime, all I have to offer you are some differential equations tutorials!
What follows are my own results of experimenting with Maple code.

<p>

<b>Basic Maple etiquette:</b>Every line (or rather, complete expression) must end 
with a colon (:) or semicolon (;) . A colon will supress the output of the line, a
semicolon will print the output of the line.<p>

This bit of Maple code:<p>

<b>
with(DEtools):<br>
dfieldplot([diff(x(t),t)=1,
diff(y(t),t)=1+x(t)*(y(t)*y(t)-3*x(t)-2)],[x(t),y(t)],t=-2..2,x=1..2,y=2..3);
</b>
<p>
will draw a direction field for the differential equation
<br>
[dy/dt] = 1+t(y<sup>2</sup>-3t-2)
<p>

This bit of Maple code:<p>

<b>
with(DEtools):<br>
DEplot([diff(x(t),t)=1,diff(y(t),t)=1+x(t)*(y(t)*y(t)-3*x(t)-2)],
[x(t),y(t)],t=-2..2,[[x(0)=1,y(0)=2],[x(0)=1,y(0)=2.1],[x(0)=1,y(0)=2.15],
[x(0)=1,y(0)=2.17],
[x(0)=1,y(0)=2.1695]],x=1..2,y=2..3,stepsize=.005);
</b>
<p>

will draw a bunch of solutions for the equation. From these examples it ought
to be fairly straightforward for you to build examples of your own; 
just replace "diff(y(t),t)=1+x(t)*(y(t)*y(t)-3*x(t)-2)" with "diff(y(t),t)= a function
of your own". Note that "x(t)" is how these examples need you to write "t".<p>

The command "dsolve" can be used to solve (symbolically) differential equations: for
example, you can try<br>

<b>dsolve(diff(y(t),t)-y(t)^2);</b><p>

This will return all solutions to the differential equation [dy/dt] - y<sup>2</sup> = 0.<br>

You can get a good sense of the fine line between equations `easy' to solve and those
that aren't by comparing Maple's answers to<br>
<b>dsolve(diff(y(t),t)-t*y(t)^2);</b><br>
and<br>
<b>dsolve(diff(y(t),t)-t*y(t)^2-1);</b><br>
(i.e., to 
[dy/dt] = ty<sup>2</sup> and [dy/dt] = ty<sup>2</sup> + 1). And while it could handle
[dy/dt] = ty<sup>2</sup> + t just fine, it couldn't do anything with 
[dy/dt] = ty<sup>2</sup> + t+ 1.<p>


<br>
To numerically solve a differential equation, using (forward) Euler's method, the following
bit of code will do the job:<p>

<b>
with(DEtools):<br>
deqn := diff(y(t), t) = y(t):<br>
init1 := y(0)=1:<br>
ans:= dsolve({deqn, init1}, {y(t)}, numeric, method=classical[foreuler], stepsize=.1):<br>
ans(1.0),ans(2.0),ans(3.0),ans(4.0),ans(5.0);<br>
</b>

<p>

You can, of course, insert your own functions into `deqn', adjust the stepsize, 
initial condition,
and points you want to evaluate your approximate solution at!<p>

Here is some code to explore the solutions to spring-mass problems:<p>

<b>
with(DEtools):<br>
m:=1: gam:= 0.0: k:= 9: om:=3.3: f(t):=cos(om*t): <br>
de := m*diff(y(t),t$2) +gam*diff(y(t),t) + k*y(t) = f(t); <br>
DEplot(de,y(t),t=0...20,[[y(0)=0,D(y)(0)=0]],stepsize=.01); </b><p>

You can, as usual, change the values of m, gam, k, and om, as well as the initial 
conditions, to generate examples of the various phenomena that we explored in class.<p>

Here is some code for exploring systems of linear first order equations:<p>

<b>with(DEtools):<br>
a:=2: b:=3: c:=-3: d:=4: <br>
charp:= k^2-(a+d)*k+(a*d-b8c); roots_:=solve(charp,k);
DEplot([diff(x(t),t)=a*x(t)+b*y(t), diff(y(t),t)=c*x(t)+d*y(t)],<br>
[x(t),y(t)],t=-10..10,color=black,linecolor=blue,<br>
[[x(0)=2,y(0)=0],[x(0)=-1,y(0)=-1],[x(0)=0,y(0)=1],<br>
[x(0)=0,y(0)=3],[x(0)=0,y(0)=-1],[x(0)=0,y(0)=-3]],<br>
x=-5..5,y=-5..5,stepsize=.01);</b>

<p>

As you can probably tell, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are the coefficients in the first
equation, while <b>c</b> and <b>d</b> belong to the second. This code will tell
you what the associated matrix is, compute its characteristic polynomial and 
eigenvalues, and
draw the direction field and a few solution curves for the equation (i.e., draw 
a phase portrait). So you can use this to see the effect on the phase portrait of 
changes to your initial matrix.<p>

A much more jazzed up version of this Maple routine can be found 
<a href="linsystems.html">here</a>; it will determine (for a 2-by-2
system) where the eigenvectors are, plot all of the straight-line
solutions, and attempt to do a good job of picking other representative
solutions. It's pretty cludgy (because I kept needing to avoid
dividing by 0), so if you know of, or figure out, or
stumble across a slicker way to do it, please let me know!
