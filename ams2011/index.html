Travel, lodging, parking, dining....
</b></font>
<p>

Brian Harbourne's <a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~bharbourne1/travelAMS2011.html">travel and lodging page</a>
contains more information than I could possibly assemble about travel and lodging arrangements for the conference.
<p>

<b>Travel:</b>
The Lincoln airport, LNK, is served by Delta and United, with direct flights to and from Chicago, Denver, 
and Minneapolis. The Omaha airport, OMA, has direct flights to far more places, and there are two shuttle
services which will take you to Lincoln. A rental car from OMA can currently (8/25/11) be had for $60-$70 for a
48 hour rental. The 65 mile drive to Lincoln takes (me) about 70 minutes. The airfare markup to fly into 
Lincoln typically exceeds the cost of the car rental?
<p>

<b>Missouri River flooding and I-29:</b> Parts of I-29 in western Iowa south and immediately north of I-80
remain closed due to flooding along the Missouri river. The <a href="http://www.iowadot.gov/floods/index.html">
Iowa DOT Flooding</a> page has a detailed map of the closures. <a href="http://www.omaha.com/article/20110727/NEWS01/707279849">Recent news
reports</a> indicate that the highway may not reopen before late this year. Those of you planning to
drive to the conference from the south and east should take this into account in your travel plans. I-80 remains
open at the Missouri River crossing; the Iowa DOT site recommends taking either I-35 to Des Moines or I-70 to
US 81 to York, and proceeding along I-80.

<p>

<b>Lodging:</b>
Special room rates have been negotiated with the Holiday Inn Downtown, the Embassy Suites, and the Suburban Hotel.
The Embassy is closest to campus, the Holiday Inn is closest to the majority of restaurants and is the main
conference hotel, and the Suburban is on the far side of downtown (and significantly less expensive). As Brian's
page states, you should call the hotel directly and ask for ``in house'' reservations in order to get the negotiated
rate, mentioning the AMS meeting. 

<p>

<b>Parking:</b>
All non-garage parking in downtown Lincoln is metered; there is a parking garage on campus near Memorial Stadium
(which the mathematics department is adjacent to) which we are being told *not* to tell you to park in,
for reasons I have yet to understand. You can find a map of garage parking <a href="parkmap.pdf">here</a>.
The garage adjacent to the Holiday Inn is owned by the hotel; parking next to the Surburban is surface 
parking and (I think) free.

<p>

<b>Food:</b>
There are restaurants throughout the downtown area of Lincoln; a map and guide to downtown can be
found <a href="DSPGuide2011.pdf">here</a>. We will have copies of this in some form for when you arrive.

<p>

<b>Talks:</b>
All session talks will take place in Avery Hall and the buildings adjacent; some plenary talks will take
place in the City Campus Union. A map of campus highlighting these two buildings can be found
<a href="campusmap3d.gif">here</a>; a rotated map, better for printing, is <a href="campusmap3d-r.gif">here</a>.

<p>

When we have final confirmation of the room(s) for our session, detailed information on the
equipment to be found in the room(s) will be posted here.

<p>

<b>Wireless:</b>
The campus has a wireless network that is free for visitors, but which requires the registration
of your computer's MAC address in order to access. Registration can be done either (less than 30 days)
ahead of time, at <a href="http://wireless-reg.unl.edu/">http://wireless-reg.unl.edu/</a>, or,
with a reported 10 minute delay, by connecting directly to the "UNL-Wireless-Registration" network
upon your arrival on campus. There are side-by-side encrypted and unencrypted networks throughout
campus; connection to the encrypted network (for greater security) requires some slightly non-standard
configuration of the connection, which campus IT provides a 
<a href="http://secure-it.unl.edu/">walkthrough</a> for.
