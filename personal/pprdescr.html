<b><i> <a name="sflam">Essential</a> laminations in Seifert-fibered 
spaces</i></b>,Topology <b>32</b> no. 1 (1993) 61-85.<br>

We show that an 
essential lamination in a Seifert-fibered space M always contains a 
sublamination which can be made either `horizontal' 
or `vertical' with respect to the foliation of M
by circles. As a consequence, we find the first 
(and, to date, only)
examples of 3-manifolds with universal cover
R^3 which do not contain any essential 
laminations.<br>

<b><i>Essential laminations and <a name="hnfone">Haken</a> normal 
form</i></b>, Pac. J. Math. <b>168</b> no. 2 (1995) 217-234.<br>

In this paper we show that, given an essential 
lamination 
in a 3-manifold M and a triangulation
\tau of M, we can find a (possibly different) 
essential 
lamination which is in Haken normal
form with respect to \tau. The technique is to build an 
infinite sequence of isotopies of the essential
lamination, and to show that these isotopies 
`converge' to a new lamination, which is in normal
form. Some sublamination of the new lamination will be essential.<br>

<b><i>Essential laminations and Haken normal 
form:
<a name="hnftwo">Regular</a> cell decompositions</i></b>, preprint (1991)<br>

This paper extends the result of the previous one 
to regular cell decompositions. The technique involves proving a 
similar convergence result,
using an infinite sequence of infinite sequences of isotopies.<br>

form:
Laminations with no holonomy</i></b>, Communications in Analysis and Geometry 
<b>3</b> (1995) 465-477<br>

The main result of this paper is that, given an 
essential lamination which has no holonomy, the infinite sequence of 
isotopies of the previous two papers are really finite sequences 
of isotopies. Consequently, the
original lamination can be put into normal form. In 
the process a better understanding of how 
the infinite sequences of isotopies generally fail to terminate 
in finite time is also achieved.<br> Download

<b><i>Essential laminations in <a name="nh">non-Haken</a> 
3-manifolds</i></b>, Topology and its Applications <b>53</b> (1993) 317-324<br>

In this paper we show that an essential lamination 
in a non-Haken 3-manifold M is `tightly-wrapped' - any 
two leaves have intersecting closures. 
We also show that this phenomenon holds for any lift 
of the essential lamination to a 
finite covering, thereby showing that `tightly-wrappedness' cannot 
be used to detect a finite covering of M which is Haken.<br>

homotopy equivalences: From essential pullback to homeomorphism</i></b>, 
Topology and its Applications <b>60</b> (1994) 249-265.<br>

The main result of this paper is that if we have a 
homotopy equivalence f from M to N, where M is irreducible and N 
contains an essential lamination L such 
that f is transverse to L and the inverse image
homotopic to a homeomorphism. This constitutes half of a program to 
show that, in the 
presence of an essential lamination, homotopy 
equivalent 3-manifolds are homeomorphic.<br>

<b><i>Essential laminations and deformations of

preprint (1994).<br>

In this paper we study the structure of the inverse 
image of an essential lamination L under a homotopy 
equivalence of non-Haken 3-manifolds. We show that the 
`tightly-wrapped' property 
of the essential lamination L (described in 
"Essential laminations in non-Haken manifolds") 
is in large part inherited by its pullback. <br>

<b><i><a name="pisurf">pi_1-injective</a>, proper maps of 
open surfaces</i></b>, preprint (1989).<br>

The main result of this paper is an analogue of 
Nielsen's 
theorem for compact surfaces : a pi_1-injective, proper 
map of open, orientable surfaces either 
has degree zero and can be properly homotoped 
off of any 
compact subset of the range, or has non-zero 
degree, and 
can be properly homotoped to a finite-sheeted covering map.<p>


<b><i>Essential laminations in <a name="eyebdl">I-bundles</a></i></b>, 
Trans. AMS <b>349</b> (1997) 1463-1485<br> 

In this paper we show that an essential lamination 
in an I-bundle over a closed surface can, with some 
well-known exceptions, be isotoped to lie 
everywhere transverse to the I-fibers. This
result, which parallels some of the results of  
the Seifert-fibered space paper, is proved using the standard cell 
decomposition of an I-bundle 
and uses the Haken normal form techniques of the Haken normal form paper.<br>

<b><i><a name="smtwobr">Small</a> Seifert-fibered spaces and Dehn

By combining the topological characterization 
of essential laminations in Seifert-fibered spaces, 
and constructions of Delman, we
show that non-integer Dehn surgery on a (non-torus) 
2-bridge knot never yields a small Seifert-fibered space.
In most cases, no non-trivial surgery can yield one. <br>

<b><i>Essential laminations in Seifert-fibered 
spaces: <a name="sflambd">Boundary</a> behavior</i></b>, to appear in Top. Appl.<br>

We show that, except for three specific manifolds M,
an essential lamination in a Seifert-fibered space M
with non-empty boundary cannot meet the boundary in a lamination
with non-vertical Reeb annuli. As a corollary, any 
essential lamination in a torus knot exterior is (with a single 
exception) isotopic to one which is everywhere transverse to the  
foliation of the exterior by circles. This paper (together with other
papers described here) finishes the topological characterization 
of essential laminations in Seifert-fibered spaces. <br>

<b>45</b> (1997) 446-470.<br>

In this paper we examine the existence of foliations without Reeb components, 
taut foliations, foliations with no torus leaves, and Anosov flows, 
among graph manifolds. We show that each condition is strictly stronger 
than its predecessor(s), in the strongest possible sense; there are manifolds 
admitting foliations of each type which do not admit foliations of the succeeding 
type(s). <br>

in analysis and Geometry.<br>

In this paper we complete the work of a previous paper, by showing that among 2-bridge 
knots, only torus knots and twist knots can admit a Dehn surgery which is a 
small Seifert-fibered space. This leads to a complete classification of surgeries 
on 2-bridge knots, according to whether the resulting manifold is finite pi_1, 
reducible, toroidal, seifert-fibered, or hyperbolic.<br>

and Dehn filling</i></b>, J. Knot Thy. Ram. <b>7</b> (1998) 425-432<br>

In this paper we show how essential laminations can be used to provide an improvement 
on (some of) the results of the well-known 2pi-Theorem; we show that at most 
20 Dehn fillings on a hyperbolic 3-manifold with boundary a torus T can yield a 
(reducible or finite pi_1 manifold or) small Seifert fibered space. The 2pi-Theorem 
gave a bound of 24.<br>

<b><i>Persistently laminar <a name="tangle">tangles</a></i></b> , J. Knot Theory and its Ramifications 
<b>8</b> (1999) 415-428.<br>

In this paper we show that an example of an essential lamination in the complement 
of the Stevedore's knot 6_1, due to Ulrich Oertel, can be associated to a certain 
tangle T_0, in a very strong way; the lamination remains essential in the complement 
of any knot K obtained by tangle sum with T_0. Even more, the lamination is 
persistent for K; it remains essential under every non-trivial Dehn filling along K. 
We also show how the construction generalizes to many more n-strand tangles. <br>

<b><i>Persistent laminations from <a name="perseif">Seifert</a> 
surfaces</i></b>, J. Knot Thy. Ram <b>10</b> (2001) 1155-1168.<br>

In this paper we give a simple construction of persistent laminations in many 
knot complements, obtained by constructing a branched surface (and knot) from 
the Seifert surface of another knot. We show that the complement of the branched 
surface is essentially the same as the complement of the Seifert surface, so 
if one starts with an incompressible Seifert surface, one obtains an essential 
branched surface. Thus far the construction provides persistent laminations for 
40 percent of the knots in the standard tables.<br> Download as a

(with R. Roberts) <b><i>When incompressible <a name="tori">tori</a> meet essential 
laminations</i></b>, Pacific J. Math. <b>190</b> (1999) 21-40.<br>

In this paper we extend to essential laminations results on isotoping taut foliations.
An essential lamination can always be isotoped so that it meets an incompressible torus 
tautly, i.e., the lamination remains essential after splitting the ambient manifold
open along the torus, <b>unless</b> the lamination contains a cylindrical component; a 
pair of parallel torus leaves, with a collection of `Reeb' annuli lying in 
between. This result plays a central role in the characterization of essential 
laminations in <a href="#graph">graph</a> manifolds, above.<br>

<b><i>Bounding <a name="canonical">canonical</a> genus

The canonical genus of a knot K is the minimum of the genera of Seifert surfaces
built by Seifert's algorithm, taken over all projections of the knot K. In 
this paper we show
for any g there is a constant C(g) so that any hyperbolic knot with canonical
genus g has volume less than C(g). The bound on volume can in fact be chosen to be linear
in g; in this paper we give a bound of 122g .<br>

In this paper we construct a family of hyperbolic knots with free genus one (i.e, they
each have a Seifert surface whose complement is a handlebody) whose complements have 
arbitrarily large volume. Together with the previous paper, these give examples of 
hyperbolic
knots with free genus one and arbitrarily large canonical genus. These also provide
examples of knots with an incompressible free Seifert surface which cannot be obtained
from Seifert's algorithm applied to a projection of the knot.<br>
