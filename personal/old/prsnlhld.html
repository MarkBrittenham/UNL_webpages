I have created at <a href="http://math.nmsu.edu/~britten/classwk.html">page</a> devoted to information and materials for my Math 192 class.<p>

I've also built a page devoted to resources related to my primary research interest, <a href="http://math.nmsu.edu/~britten/ldt/ldt.html">low-dimensional topology</a>.<p>

If you want, you can take a look at my latest (html-ized) <a href="vita.html">vita</a>, as well as the latest version of my <a href="myresold.html">research plans</a>. In the meantime....<p>

You can take a look at the <a href="http://math.nmsu.edu/~britten/papers.html">papers and preprints</a> that I have managed to load onto the web so far.<p>

It dawned on me that all of this is <font size=+1> professional</font> information, not personal information! So what can I tell you about myself? 
And why would you want to know any of it? Let's see, I'm a fan of rock music of the late 60's/early 70's, my favorite bands being (in no particular order) Yes (the ABWH line-up particularly, and almost all of the solo projects spawned from it), Renaissance, Boston, Three Dog Night, Grand Funk Railroad, Focus, and a bunch of other bands you've probably never heard of. I like hiking and backpacking, which you would think I would do more of considering there are mountains that are 5000 feet higher than where I am sitting, only 10 miles away, but what can I tell you.... Except, of course, I am afraid of spiders, and around here you have a choice of black widows, scorpions, and/or tarantulas, depending on where you stand. I figure they have a harder time finding me if I stay indoors (or is this just a massive rationalization?).<p>

I collect things. Most anything. I am fairly proud of my collections of books (mostly SF, history, and atlases), maps, records, stamps, coins (British, mostly; who wants to collect US coins in the US? No challenge.), petrified wood (don't ask), bandanas (ditto!), and I'm sure I could think of a few more if I gave it half a chance. I recently picked up 12 railroad spikes from the side of a railroad for no apparent reason. I've heard that collecting should be classified as a mental illness, and I don't necessarily disagree.<p>

I like working with puzzles; my office is adorned with lots of those geometric `tavern puzzles', which people occasionally mistake for bondage devices. I wonder if this has any effect on the number of students who come to my office hours?<p>
