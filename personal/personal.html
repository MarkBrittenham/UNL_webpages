I've built a page devoted to resources related to my 
primary research interest, 
<a href="../ldt/ldt.html">low-dimensional topology</a>.
(It's probably the only really GOOD thing I've done on (for?) the web, so far!)<p>

If you want, you can take a look at an old (html-ized) <a href="vita00d.html">vita</a>, or the most
up-to-date one, as a <a href="britten_vita_2002.ps">Postscript</a> file or
<a href="britten_vita_2002.pdf">PDF</a>. There is also the latest version of my 
<a href="research.pdf">research plans</a>, extracted from my most recent NSF proposal. In 
the meantime....<p>

You can take a look at the <a href="../papers.html">papers and 
preprints</a> that I have managed to load onto the web so far.<p>

It dawned on me that all of this is <font size=+1> professional</font> 
information, not personal information! So what can I tell you about myself? 
And why would you want to know any of it? Let's see, I'm a fan of rock 
music of the late 60's/early 70's, my favorite bands being (in no 
particular order) <a href="http://southside.org/">Yes</a> 
(the ABWH line-up particularly, and almost all 
of the solo projects spawned from it), 
<a href="http://user.mc.net/jtl/nlights/">Renaissance</a>, 
<a href="http://www.boston.org/main.html">Boston</a>, 
<a href="http://www.threedognight.com/">Three Dog Night</a>, 
<a href="http://w3.one.net/~wap/GFR_WEB/">Grand Funk Railroad</a>,
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Alley/8267/index.html">Focus</a>, 
<a href="http://LauraNyro.net/">Laura Nyro</a>, 
and a bunch of other bands 
you've probably never heard of. I like hiking and backpacking, 
which you would think I would have done more of during my year at NMSU, 
considering that in Las Cruces there are mountains that are 5000 feet 
higher than the campus, only 10 miles away, but what can I tell you.... Except, 
of course, that I am afraid of spiders, and around there you have a choice 
of black widows, scorpions, brown recluses, and/or tarantulas, depending on where you 
are standing at the time! I figure they had a harder time finding me if I 
stayed indoors (or is that just a massive rationalization?). So far 
(1/5/99) here at UNL the average daytime temperature has been about 10 
degrees F (BTW, never ever never try moving in December, especially across
that mystical line north of which things (e.g. roads) freeze), so the question 
of what kinds of critters I need to avoid when out-of-doors has not really 
come up yet.<p>

I collect things. Most anything. I am fairly proud of my collections of 
books (mostly scifi, history, and atlases), maps, records 
(i.e., LP's), stamps, coins (British, mostly; who wants 
to collect US coins in the US? No challenge.), petrified wood (don't ask), 
bandanas (ditto!), colored pencils, coffee (well, actually, tea) mugs, and T-shirts.
I'm sure I could think of a few 
more if I gave it half a chance. 
There's a great store called 
<a href="http://www2.vinylvendors.com/VinylVendors/">Vinyl Vendors</a> which 
specializes in promotional 
45's and CD singles, that has been getting alot of my money recently. Do you 
think they'll give me a discount for this plug? (BTW, my favorite plug is at
<a href="http://www.delta.com">www.delta.com</a>; it's prescious.) I've heard that 
the collecting bug should be classified as a mental illness, and I don't 
necessarily disagree. Well, OK, I do; I don't miss meals because of it. 
I only do that when I'm working too hard on a math problem. And you 
can draw your own conclusions on what <b> that </b> means.<p>

I like working with puzzles; my office is adorned with lots of those wrought 
iron geometric 
`tavern puzzles', which people occasionally mistake for bondage devices. 
I wonder if this has any effect on the number of students who come to my 
office hours? An occasional student <b>does</b> get trapped in my office 
because of them, but that's because the student won't let go of the puzzle, 
not because the puzzle won't let go of the student!<p>

By the way, in case you care, my 
<a href="http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/erdoshp.html">Erd&ouml;s number</a> is
less than or equal to <a href="enum.html">four</a>.
